bins	Binary MSD radix sort, also called binary quicksort, can be implemented in-place by splitting the input array into two bins - the 0s bin and the 1s bin.
bins	As the array elements are scanned the bins are skipped over and only elements between bins are processed, until the entire array has been processed and all elements end up in their respective bins.
bins	The number of bins is the same as the radix used - e.g.
bins	This extra memory allows the input buffer to be scanned from the first array element to last, and move the array elements to the destination bins in the same order.
bins	Each of the bins are recursively processed, as is done for the in-place MSD radix sort.
bins	Thus, when the bins get small, other sorting algorithms should be used, such as insertion sort.
bins	This recursive sorting algorithm has particular application to parallel computing, as each of the bins can be sorted independently.
bins	For random inputs all bins would be near equally populated and a large amount of parallelism opportunity would be available.

bins	During initial training to optimize transmission quality and speed, the ADSL modem tests each of the bins to determine the signal-to-noise ratio at each bin's frequency.
bins	Those bins that have a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will be chosen to transmit signals chosen from a greater number of possible encoded values (this range of possibilities equating to more bits of data sent) in each main clock cycle.
bins	Noisy bins may only be required to carry as few as two bits, a choice from only one of four possible patterns, or only one bit per bin in the case of ADSL2+, and very noisy bins are not used at all.
bins	"If the pattern of noise versus frequencies heard in the bins changes, the DSL modem can alter the bits-per-bin allocations, in a process called ""bitswap"", where bins that have become noisier are only required to carry fewer bits and other channels will be chosen to be given a higher burden."
bins	The data transfer capacity the DSL modem therefore reports is determined by the total of the bits-per-bin allocations of all the bins combined.
bins	Higher signal-to-noise ratios and more bins being in use gives a higher total link capacity, while lower signal-to-noise ratios or fewer bins being used gives a low link capacity.
bins	For vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used.

bins	Note that even in this idealized example, in general, we must steer over the 2-D angle-Doppler plane at discrete points to detect potential targets (moving the location of the 2-D sinc main lobe shown in the figure), and do so for each of the range bins in our system.
bins	In general, this adaptive filtering must be performed for each of the unambiguous range bins in the system, for each target of interest (angle-Doppler coordinates), making for a massive computational burden.
bins	Since the target response is already steered to a specified angle-Doppler location, the dimensionality can be reduced by pre-processing multiple Doppler bins and angles surrounding this point.

vise	A woodworking vise is a type of vise adapted to the various needs of woodworkers and woodworking.
vise	"There are two main locations for a vise (""vice"" in UK English sp.)"
vise	Either or both may be mounted on the right side of their face to allow a workpiece extending from them to be more easily worked by a right-handed person, though a common arrangement is with the front vise mounted on the left of a long side and the tail on the right side of the diagonally opposite end.
vise	A woodworking vise holds work in its jaws, or compressed against a bench dog or holdfast.
vise	"Holes to receive these stops or clamps are typically drilled in line with a vise in 3-4"" intervals, with others added to the benchtop to serve various purposes."
vise	In addition to the single screwed standard iron-jawed vise there are both quick-release and twin-screw variations:
vise	"A quick-release (or ""quick-action"") vise employs a split nut that allows its screw to engage or disengage with a half-turn of the handle."
vise	This design has many of the advantages of the classic shoulder vise and single screw face vise, with few of the disadvantages.
vise	Probably the oldest front vise design is the leg vise, which uses one of the bench's legs as its inside jaw.
vise	The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.
vise	This is one vise that should be designed into the bench from the beginning, as it is difficult to retrofit into an existing bench.
vise	"The primary drawback of the shoulder vise is its fragility, unless the ""arm"" is attached to the ""end cap"" using a dovetail or finger joint, usually glued or ""pinned"" to eliminate rotative movement about the joint, otherwise it is fairly easy to break it with a big steel bench screw."
vise	Some woodworkers say that the big vise gets in the way of some jobs, others find it unobtrusive.
vise	"Implicit in a shoulder vise is an integral planing stop, formed by the intersection of the jaw and the jaw spacer, and which allows the shoulder vise to perform multiple duties, such as jointing long boards with a ""bench slave"" to hold the opposite end."
vise	Many of the commercial European benches have a front vise that uses a wooden jaw with a metal screw and built-in anti-racking hardware.
vise	The patternmaker's vise can hold odd shapes at various angles, and it can certainly hold simple shapes at regular angles.
vise	The drawbacks of this vise are the expense, the moderately complicated mounting, and a tendency to fragility.
vise	"A possible disadvantage of the patternmaker's vise is it usually requires installation on a bench which is at least 1-3/4"" thick"
vise	The traditional tail vise uses one large screw, either wooden or metal.
vise	Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.
vise	This traditional tail vise also uses one large screw, either wooden or metal.
vise	The two main varieties of this vise depend on whether the screw nut is mounted in the bench or on the dog hole block.
vise	When the screw nut is mounted on the dog hole block the installation is more complicated and expensive, but the screw does not move in and out as the vise is used.
vise	A newer form of tail vise does away with the need of a frame.
vise	A steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so much from this problem.

vise	Lastly, the knife is placed into a vise and flexed for 90 degrees.
vise	The vise has two jaws (1 and 2 in the illustration) which are set to the desired line width.
vise	When the line is justified, the matrices fit tightly between the vise jaws, forming a tight seal that will prevent the molten type metal from escaping when the line is cast.
vise	A safety mechanism in the justification vise detects this and blocks the casting operation.
vise	"The justification vise holds the assembled line against the face of the ""mold disk""."
vise	Studs in the mold disc engage with blocks on the vise so that the mold disc seats gently, yet tightly and squarely against the line of matrices held in the first elevator jaws and between the vise jaws.
vise	The vise jaws compress the line of matrices so molten metal is prevented from squeezing between the mats on cast.
vise	The mold disk retracts from the vise studs which held it in perfect relation to the mold, thus breaking the slug away from the matrices.

tape	The RCA tape cartridge (labeled the RCA Sound Tape Cartridge) is a magnetic tape audio format that was designed to offer stereo quarter-inch reel-to-reel tape recording quality in a convenient format for the consumer market.
tape	The main advantage of the RCA tape cartridge over reel-to-reel machines is convenience.
tape	The user is not required to handle unruly tape ends and thread the tape through the machine before use, making the medium of magnetic tape more friendly to casual users.
tape	In addition, since the cartridge carries both supply and take-up reels, the cartridge does not have to be rewound before the tape is removed from the machine and stored.
tape	Because of these conveniences, the RCA tape cartridge system did see some success in schools, particularly in student language learning labs.
tape	An auto-reverse mechanism in some models allows the tape to run continuously.

paver	"To comply with most paver manufacturers warranties and ICPI (International Concrete Paver Institute) specifications, up to 1"" of bedding sand for the pavers should be used and shall not exceed a maximum of 1 1/2""."
paver	Modular, fluid thermal transfer panel systems provide full and even heat exchange with the entire paver or concrete area as opposed to the spacing required by a tube based system.
paver	They may also be utilized to cool the pavement surface, particularly around swimming pools or on pedestal mounted rooftop paver terraces which get very hot due to the paver being uncoupled from the building thus creating a solar battery which in turn increases the urban heat island effect in the immediate vicinity.

skids	The beginning of tourist development was marked by the construction of a Funi track (a Funi was a mechanism by which two carriages on skids pulled each other up and down the mountain) between Val Sporz and Tgantieni in 1936.
skids	With the canopy removed, a set of skids attached to the main landing gear as well as ventral fin added to the tail, it sufficed as more-or-less a visual lookalike.
skids	Countering these assertions on 23 March NBC News reported the evacuation of an ARVN regiment on Route 9 where soldiers clung to the skids of helicopters rather than waiting for more helicopters that might not come.

manual	If it is included, the Solo manual is usually placed above the Swell.
manual	Some larger organs contain an Echo or Antiphonal division, usually controlled by a manual placed above the Solo.
manual	On French instruments, the main manual (the Grand Orgue) is at the bottom, with the Positif and the Récit above it.
manual	Organists will frequently mark a part in their music with the number of the manual they intend to play it on, and this is sometimes seen in the original composition, typically in pieces written when organs were smaller and only had two or three manuals.
manual	Portative organs may have a range of only an octave or two, while a few large organs, such as the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ, may have some manual keyboards approaching the size of a modern piano.
manual	"German organs of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries featured manual ranges from C to f′′′ and pedal ranges from C to d′, though some organs only had manual ranges that extended down to F. Many French organs of this period had pedal ranges that went down to AA (though this ""ravalement"" applied only to the reeds, and may have only included the low AA, not AA-sharp or BB)."
manual	French organs of the nineteenth century typically had manual ranges from C to g′′′ and pedal ranges from C to f′; in the twentieth century the manual range was extended to a′′′.
manual	The modern console specification recommended by the American Guild of Organists calls for manual keyboards with sixty-one notes (five octaves, from C to c′′′′) and pedal keyboards with thirty-two notes (two and a half octaves, from C to g′).
manual	Enclosure is the term for the device that allows volume control (crescendo and diminuendo) for a manual without the addition or subtraction of stops.
manual	It is unnecessary to couple the pipes of a division to the manual of the same name (for example, coupling the Great division to the Great manual), because those stops play by default on that manual (though this is done with super- and sub-couplers, see below).
manual	On a mechanical-action organ, a coupler may connect one division's manual directly to the other, actually moving the keys of the first manual when the second is played.
manual	In addition, the unison off couplers can be used with other couplers to change the order of the manuals at the console: engaging the Great to Choir and Choir to Great couplers along with the Great unison off and Choir unison off couplers would have the effect of moving the Great to the bottom manual and the Choir to the middle manual.
manual	This is a device that allows the sounds played on the pedals to be split, so the lower octave (principally that of the left foot) plays stops from the pedal division while the upper half (played by the right foot), plays stops from one of the manual divisions.
manual	The choice of manual is at the discretion of the performer, as is the 'split point' of the system.
manual	The manual and the sample programs use Python by default, with C++ available as an alternate.

manual	Due to the rising importance of knowledge work (as opposed to manual work), many researchers tried to develop productivity measurement means that can be applied in a non-manufacturing context.

manual	These LEDs were also used for TTL Electronic Focus assisted manual focus.
manual	After lightly pressing the shutter button, the photographer would turn Pentax brand manual focus lenses in the direction of whichever red arrow LED lit until the green LED lit to indicate sharp focus.

manual	The viewfinder also had a fixed focusing screen with Asahi Optical's standard split image rangefinder and microprism collar manual focusing aids.
manual	Although the ME F was a highly electronic camera normally dependent on battery power, it had a backup ability to operate without batteries, though in a very limited fashion: completely manual mechanical control with two shutter speeds (1/125th second, marked 125X, and Bulb; both accessed from the mode dial) and without the light meter or AF.

monorail	"The line will connect to the 'Green' and 'Blue' lines to be built by ""PT Jakarta Monorail"" In early May 2013 the SOE consortium unveiled a mockup of their own prototype monorail car, built by PT INKA in Jakarta."
monorail	This plan eventually evolved into the Greater Jakarta LRT, which is not based on monorail technology, but will reuse some of the monorail pillars.
monorail	A number of commentators and analysts have criticised the monorail on grounds of costs (compared to busway) or lack of capacity (compared to a subway or heavy rail) as well as unrealistic predictions.
monorail	"In 2008, the former Mayor of Bogotá, Colombia, Enrique Peñalosa also called for Jakarta to expand the busways instead of monorail or subways; he told a seminar that ""[A] subway would cost three times its contract value, yet it would only cover several lines, (but) with the same amount of money you could reach all parts of the city with the (busway) network,""."
monorail	The monorail line design; loop Green line and Blue line, has gained criticism, as it only connects shopping malls in Jakarta's city center, and would not connect to suburban Jakarta that desperately need transportation infrastructure; thus would not be useful for many Jakartan commuters.
monorail	Transportation experts deemed that the city center monorail project would not answer Jakarta's traffic problems, but would only serves as a novelty tourists' ride.
monorail	"In November 2012, the Director of the Institute of Transportation Studies, Darmaningtyas, said the capacity of the monorail was too limited, it was not economic and not suitable for Jakarta: ""Everything has to be built, including the train depot."
monorail	"Jakarta Governor Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama stated on 10 September 2015 that negotiations with monorail project operator PT Jakarta Monorail (JM) would not continue, meaning total discontinuation of the infrastructure project."

balancer	For Internet services, a server-side load balancer is usually a software program that is listening on the port where external clients connect to access services.
balancer	"The load balancer forwards requests to one of the ""backend"" servers, which usually replies to the load balancer."
balancer	This allows the load balancer to reply to the client without the client ever knowing about the internal separation of functions.
balancer	This might include forwarding to a backup load balancer or displaying a message regarding the outage.
balancer	It is also important that the load balancer itself does not become a single point of failure.
balancer	Ideally, the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should not be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected.
balancer	If the load balancer is replaced or fails, this information may be lost, and assignments may need to be deleted after a timeout period or during periods of high load to avoid exceeding the space available for the assignment table.
balancer	Storing session data on the client is generally the preferred solution: then the load balancer is free to pick any backend server to handle a request.
balancer	The fundamental feature of a load balancer is to be able to distribute incoming requests over a number of backend servers in the cluster according to a scheduling algorithm.
balancer	To remove this demand on Web servers, a balancer can terminate TLS connections, passing HTTPS requests as HTTP requests to the Web servers.
balancer	If the balancer itself is not overloaded, this does not noticeably degrade the performance perceived by end-users.
balancer	One clear benefit to TLS offloading in the balancer is that it enables it to do balancing or content switching based on data in the HTTPS request.
balancer	The trade-off is that this feature puts additional CPU demand on the load balancer and could be done by web servers instead.
balancer	The load balancer can buffer responses from the server and spoon-feed the data out to slow clients, allowing the webserver to free a thread for other tasks faster than it would if it had to send the entire request to the client directly.
balancer	The balancer polls servers for application layer health and removes failed servers from the pool.
balancer	The balancer stores static content so that some requests can be handled without contacting the servers.
balancer	At least one balancer allows the use of a scripting language to allow custom balancing methods, arbitrary traffic manipulations, and more.
balancer	The components are monitored continually (e.g., web servers may be monitored by fetching known pages), and when one becomes unresponsive, the load balancer is informed and no longer sends traffic to it.
balancer	When a component comes back online, the load balancer starts rerouting traffic to it.
balancer	The engine had twin balancer shafts to reduce vibration, one in front of the crankshaft and one to the rear, both moving in the opposite direction to the rotating crankshaft.

headgear	In the Middle Ages in Europe, the distinctive Jewish headgear was the Jewish hat, a full hat with a brim and a central point or stalk.
headgear	Historically, the wool knit cap was an extremely common form of headgear for seamen, fishers, hunters and others spending their working day outdoors from the 18th century and forward, and is still commonly used for this purpose in the northern regions of North America, Europe, Asia, and other cold regions of the world.
headgear	"Members of the United States military commonly refer to a knitted cap as a watch cap, as it is the headgear worn while ""standing watch"" on a ship or guard post."
pendulum	The combination of a trigger-operated flash pan cover and small copper rain cover mounted on a pendulum was considered a more sophisticated approach to the Japanese solution of covering the entire firing mechanism with a lacquered box, which could hamper aiming, shooting and reloading.
pendulum	The SABS solved this with a pendulum mechanism consisting of a weight on the end of an L-shaped bracket.
pendulum	He was sometimes exuberant and full of humour, though occasionally the pendulum swung the other way.
pendulum	"They come across two physicists (Barnes and Henderson) who are investigating a strange liquid that exhibits negentropy, which Davis describes as being akin to ""Time's Arrow"" as ""Any clock you care to mention – a pendulum for instance – might just as easily run forward as backward."
pendulum	Until the 20th century, the best timekeepers were pendulum clocks, but both the rolling of a ship at sea and the up to 0.2% variations in the gravity of Earth made a simple gravity-based pendulum useless both in theory and in practice.
pendulum	Christiaan Huygens, following his invention of the pendulum clock in 1656, made the first attempt at a marine chronometer in 1673 in France, under the sponsorship of Jean-Baptiste Colbert.
pendulum	Ship’s marine chronometers are the most exact portable mechanical timepieces ever produced and in a static environment were only trumped by non-portable precision pendulum clocks for observatories.
pendulum	The pendulum now swung the other way, as he sang mainly in English and married a blue-eyed, blond former Mrs. Houston.
pendulum	Senses the deceleration of the vehicle through a pendulum or similar device to apply a suitable current for braking of the trailer.
pendulum	There are other techniques used in Britain, but these three techniques remain the more popular ones with the pendulum cast perhaps the most difficult to master and also the one that generally produces more yards to the cast with 250–300 yds becoming quite possible.
pendulum	Benjamin Robins (1707–1751) invented the ballistic pendulum that measures the momentum of the projectile fired by a gun.
pendulum	The ballistic pendulum could make only one measurement per firing because the device catches the projectile.
pendulum	The pantelegraph used a regulating clock with a pendulum which made and broke the current for magnetizing its regulators, and ensured that the transmitter's scanning stylus and the receiver's writing stylus remained in step.
pendulum	To provide a time base, a large pendulum was used weighing , mounted on a frame high.
pendulum	Two messages were written with insulating ink on two fixed metal plates; one plate was scanned as the pendulum moved to the right and the other as the pendulum moved to the left, so that two messages could be transmitted per cycle.
pendulum	Specifically, it comprises two masses (the pendulum, mass m and counterweight, mass M) connected by an inextensible, massless string suspended on two frictionless pulleys of zero radius such that the pendulum can swing freely around its pulley without colliding with the counterweight.
pendulum	either the pendulum or counterweight eventually collides with its pulley), except for formula_1.
pendulum	Numerical studies indicate that when the orbit is singular (initial conditions: formula_49), the pendulum executes a single symmetrical loop and returns to the origin, regardless of the value of formula_50.
pendulum	Since the system is invariant under time reversal and translation, it is equivalent to say that the pendulum starts at the origin and is fired outwards:
pendulum	Networks of electric clocks connected by wires to a precision master pendulum clock began to be used in institutions like factories, offices, and schools around 1900.
pendulum	The master clock was usually a precision pendulum clock with a seconds pendulum and a robust mechanism.
pendulum	In more recent years, the company has found success in producing large thrill rides such as the Booster, a pendulum ride which has sold over 50 units since 2000.
pendulum	They had refined their experimental setup, using a three-wire torsion pendulum to measure thrust, and tested two different power setups.
pendulum	Testing was performed first on a knife-edge beam balance able to detect force at the micronewton level, atop an antivibration granite table at ambient air pressure; then on a torsion pendulum with a force resolution of 0.1 mN, inside a vacuum chamber at ambient air pressure and in a hard vacuum at .
pendulum	In 1927, his prowess with the pendulum stroke led to that also being banned from use in competition.
pendulum	"In the 1927 championship, against Inman, Reece played a series of pendulum cannons, where the object balls are trapped at the &lt;dfn id=""""&gt;jaws&lt;/dfn&gt; of the pocket for successive cannons."
pendulum	Reece scored 568 consecutive cannons which prompted the Billiards Association and Control Club to prohibit the pendulum cannon in the rules.
pendulum	In the XII-XIV centuries a pendulum clock was installed in one of the towers.
pendulum	While at Yale, Scripture developed a timer for studying reaction times known as a pendulum chronoscope, otherwise known as a pendulum timer.
pendulum	The first instruments of the observatory were a 15-cm Unitron telescope, a Foucault pendulum and an Iris photometer.
pendulum	The pendulum weighed and the pendulum was long, which oscillated only 30 times per minute.
pendulum	Atmos is the brand name of a mechanical torsion pendulum clock manufactured by Jaeger-LeCoultre in Switzerland which does not need to be wound manually.
pendulum	The torsion pendulum has a period of precisely one minute; thirty seconds to rotate in one direction and thirty seconds to return to the starting position.
pendulum	This is thirty times slower than the 0.994 m (39.1 in) seconds pendulum typically found in a longcase clock, where each swing (or half-period) takes one second.
pendulum	Regarding the movement, it is an 8-day weight driven, pendulum regulated clock and, as well as the cases, there were a considerable variety of mechanisms in terms of workmanship and design.
pendulum	One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider similar to the way a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.
pendulum	It can also be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, essentially an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable.
pendulum	The equations show that the bicycle is like an inverted pendulum with the lateral position of its support controlled by terms representing roll acceleration, roll velocity and roll displacement to steering torque feedback.
pendulum	Poinsot was a contemporary of Léon Foucault, who invented the gyroscope and whose pendulum experiments provided incontrovertible evidence that the Earth rotates.
pendulum	The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.
pendulum	Already, however, there are signs that the pendulum is swinging back again, away from pure centralization, as thin client devices become more like diskless workstations due to increased computing power, and web applications start to do more processing on the client side, with technologies such as AJAX and rich clients.
pendulum	His interest was sparked by his discovery that, at least for small swings, the pendulum is isochronous; its period of swing is the same for different size swings.
pendulum	He realized that this property made the pendulum useful for timekeeping.
pendulum	He also discovered that the pendulum's period is dependent on its length, and independent of the mass of the pendulum bob.
pendulum	In 1637, when he was 73, Galileo had the idea of a mechanism that would keep the pendulum swinging by giving it pushes, an escapement, thus allowing it to be applied to clocks.
pendulum	One day in 1641, while I was living with him at his villa in Arcetri, I remember that the idea occurred to him that the pendulum could be adapted to clocks with weights or springs, serving in place of the usual tempo, he hoping that the very even and natural motions of the pendulum would correct all the defects in the art of clocks.
pendulum	The first pendulum clock was built in 1657 by Christiaan Huygens using a different design.
pendulum	The pendulum clock remained the world's most accurate timekeeper for 300 years, until the 1930s.
pendulum	To stop the tower from moving in the wind a giant steel pendulum weighing is held from eight wires near the rooftop.
pendulum	"Above him is a picture of Father Time, holding a pendulum measuring ""one foot from horn to horn""."
pendulum	The pendulum is swinging back and forth and slowly descending, designed to kill the narrator eventually.
pendulum	The rats chew through the straps, and he slips free just before the pendulum can begin to slice into his chest.
pendulum	The pendulum is withdrawn into the ceiling, and the walls become red-hot and start to move inwards, forcing him slowly toward the center of the room and into the pit.
pendulum	"The original source of the pendulum torture method is one paragraph in the preface of the 1826 book ""The history of the Inquisition of Spain "" by the Spanish priest, historian, and activist, Juan Antonio Llorente, relating a second-hand account by a single prisoner released from the Inquisition's Madrid dungeon in 1820, who purportedly described the pendulum torture method."
pendulum	"The ""realism"" of the story is enhanced through Poe's focus on reporting : the dungeon is airless and unlit, the narrator is subject to thirst and starvation, he is swarmed by rats, the razor-sharp pendulum threatens to slice into him and the closing walls are red-hot."
pendulum	Effectively, this causes a double pendulum motion, with the top of the pole moving forward and pivoting from the box, while the vaulter acts as a second pendulum pivoting from the right hand.
pendulum	The first timekeepers that could count seconds accurately were pendulum clocks invented in the 17th century.
pendulum	Some common events in seconds are: a stone falls about 4.9 meters from rest in one second; a pendulum of length about one meter has a swing of one second, so pendulum clocks have pendulums about a meter long; the fastest human sprinters run 10 meters in a second; an ocean wave in deep water travels about 23 meters in one second; sound travels about 343 meters in one second in air; light takes 1.3 seconds to reach Earth from the surface of the Moon, a distance of 384,400 kilometers.
pendulum	In 1656, Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens invented the first pendulum clock.
pendulum	It had a pendulum length of just under a meter which gave it a swing of one second, and an escapement that ticked every second.
pendulum	"A simple formula from the field of classical mechanics gives the approximate period ""T"" of a simple pendulum of length ""L"", swinging with a small amplitude (""g"" is the earth's gravitational acceleration):"
pendulum	This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.
pendulum	It was a mechanism consisting of a hydrostatic valve and pendulum that caused the torpedo's hydroplanes to be adjusted to maintain a preset depth.
pendulum	It was a mechanism consisting of a hydrostatic valve and pendulum that caused the torpedo's hydroplanes to be adjusted so as to maintain a preset depth.
pendulum	When a pendulum or an object attached to a spring swings in an ellipse, the inward acceleration/force is proportional to the distance formula_7 Due to the way vectors add, the component of the force in the formula_8 or in the formula_9 directions are also proportionate to the respective components of the distances, formula_10.
pendulum	This is similar to the effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point; the highest point of the pendulum's swing becomes lower.
pendulum	Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging pendulum and alternating current.
pendulum	For example, two pendulum clocks (of identical frequency) mounted on a common wall will tend to synchronise.
pendulum	"In the 1960s, Lockheed and MIT with the United States Department of Commerce conducted feasibility studies on a vactrain system powered by ambient atmospheric pressure and ""gravitational pendulum assist"" to connect cities on the country's East Coast."
pendulum	Other phenomena can be modeled by simple harmonic motion, including the motion of a simple pendulum, although for it to be an accurate model, the net force on the object at the end of the pendulum must be proportional to the displacement (and even so, it is only a good approximation when the angle of the swing is small; see small-angle approximation).
pendulum	In the small-angle approximation, the motion of a simple pendulum is approximated by simple harmonic motion.
pendulum	"The period of a mass attached to a pendulum of length ""l"" with gravitational acceleration formula_24 is given by"
pendulum	This shows that the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude and mass of the pendulum but not of the acceleration due to gravity, formula_24, therefore a pendulum of the same length on the Moon would swing more slowly due to the Moon's lower gravitational field strength.
pendulum	The development of the armoured tank and improved infantry tactics at the end of World War I swung the pendulum back in favour of manoeuvre, and with the advent of Blitzkrieg in 1939, the end of traditional siege warfare was at hand.
pendulum	"The rocket engine was at the top and the fuel tank at the bottom of the rocket, based on Goddard's belief that the rocket would achieve stability by ""hanging"" from the engine like a pendulum in flight."
pendulum	A pendulum clock is a clock that uses a pendulum, a swinging weight, as its timekeeping element.
pendulum	The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping is that it is an approximate harmonic oscillator: It swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates.
pendulum	From its invention in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens, inspired by Galileo Galilei, until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world's most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use.
pendulum	Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, pendulum clocks in homes, factories, offices, and railroad stations served as primary time standards for scheduling daily life, work shifts, and public transportation.
pendulum	The home pendulum clock was replaced by less-expensive, synchronous, electric clocks in the 1930s and '40s.
pendulum	The pendulum clock was invented on 25 December 1656 by Dutch scientist and inventor Christiaan Huygens, and patented the following year.
pendulum	Galileo discovered the key property that makes pendulums useful timekeepers: isochronism, which means that the period of swing of a pendulum is approximately the same for different sized swings.
pendulum	"Galileo in 1637 described to his son a mechanism which could keep a pendulum swinging, which has been called the first pendulum clock design ""(picture at top)""."
pendulum	By 1659 pendulum clocks were being manufactured in France by clockmaker Nicolaus Hanet, and in England by Ahasuerus Fromanteel.
pendulum	These early clocks, due to their verge escapements, had wide pendulum swings of 80–100°.
pendulum	"In his 1673 analysis of pendulums, ""Horologium Oscillatorium"", Huygens showed that wide swings made the pendulum inaccurate, causing its period, and thus the rate of the clock, to vary with unavoidable variations in the driving force provided by the movement."
pendulum	In addition to increased accuracy, the anchor's narrow pendulum swing allowed the clock's case to accommodate longer, slower pendulums, which needed less power and caused less wear on the movement.
pendulum	The seconds pendulum (also called the Royal pendulum), long, in which the time period is two seconds, became widely used in quality clocks.
pendulum	The 18th and 19th century wave of horological innovation that followed the invention of the pendulum brought many improvements to pendulum clocks.
pendulum	"The deadbeat escapement invented in 1675 by Richard Towneley and popularized by George Graham around 1715 in his precision ""regulator"" clocks gradually replaced the anchor escapement and is now used in most modern pendulum clocks."
pendulum	Observation that pendulum clocks slowed down in summer brought the realization that thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum rod with changes in temperature was a source of error.
pendulum	This was solved by the invention of temperature-compensated pendulums; the mercury pendulum by Graham in 1721 and the gridiron pendulum by John Harrison in 1726.
pendulum	With these improvements, by the mid-18th century precision pendulum clocks achieved accuracies of a few seconds per week.
pendulum	The rich ornamentation of pendulum clocks of this period indicates their value as status symbols of the wealthy.
pendulum	By the 19th century, factory production of clock parts gradually made pendulum clocks affordable by middle-class families.
pendulum	"More accurate pendulum clocks, called ""regulators"", were installed in places of business and railroad stations and used to schedule work and set other clocks."
pendulum	"The need for extremely accurate timekeeping in celestial navigation to determine longitude on ships during long sea voyages drove the development of the most accurate pendulum clocks, called ""astronomical regulators""."
pendulum	From 1909, US National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the US time standard on Riefler pendulum clocks, accurate to about 10 milliseconds per day.
pendulum	In 1929 it switched to the Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock before phasing in quartz standards in the 1930s.
pendulum	With an error of less than one second per year, the Shortt was the most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock.
bascinet	"Other contemporary sources refer explicitly to head injuries and the weapons used to kill Richard; the French chronicler Jean Molinet wrote that ""one of the Welshmen then came after him, and struck him dead with a halberd"", and the ""Ballad of Lady Bessie"" recorded that ""they struck his bascinet to his head until his brains came out with blood""."
bascinet	However, this helmet is considerably taller and of a conical 'pear shape', indeed it bears some similarity in outline to the later bascinet helmets of Western Europe.
bascinet	The bascinet had a mail curtain attached, a camail or aventail, which superseded the coif.
bascinet	The bascinet evolved from its early skull cap form to supersede the great helm for combat.
bascinet	In 1419 he was again in France as Captain of Mantes, and on 31 January 1419 was granted the comté of Tancarville in Normandy to hold by grand sergeanty of delivery of a bascinet helmet at the Castle of Roan on Saint George's Day each year.
bascinet	The most visible armour transformation in medieval times was that of the helmet, which changed its shape from a conical shape into a great helm (11th-12th century) and later to the bascinet with different shapes in following centuries.
bascinet	A visor was an armored covering for the face often used in conjunction with Late Medieval war helmets such as the bascinet or sallet.
bascinet	Klappvisier bascinet with mail aventail, quilted arming cap, gambeson, mail shirt, coat of plates based on the Visby No.1 coat of plates, simple jointed arm harness,
bascinet	As more plate armour appeared to supplement mail during the 14th century, the bascinet helmet incorporated a mail curtain called the aventail which protected the lower face, neck and shoulders.
bascinet	The latter portion of the 14th century saw the cuirass gradually come into general use in connection with plate armour for the limbs until, at the close of the century, mail was phased out among the nobles (e.g., knights) except in the camail of the bascinet and at the edge of the hauberk.
bascinet	The visored bascinet helmet was a new development in this century.
bascinet	"The sallet (also called ""celata,"" ""salade"" and ""schaller"") was a combat helmet that replaced the bascinet in Italy, western and northern Europe and Hungary during the mid-15th century."
bascinet	The bascinet – also bassinet, basinet, or bazineto – was a Medieval European open-faced combat helmet.
bascinet	It is believed that the bascinet evolved from a simple iron skullcap, known as the cervelliere, which was worn with a mail coif, as either the sole form of head protection or beneath a great helm.
bascinet	The bascinet is differentiated from the cervelliere by having a higher, pointed skull.
bascinet	By about 1330 the bascinet had been extended lower down the sides and back of the head.
bascinet	The bascinet appeared quite suddenly in the later 13th century and some authorities see it as being influenced by Byzantine or Middle-Eastern Muslim helmets.
bascinet	The detachable aventail was attached to a leather band, which was in turn attached to the lower border of the bascinet by a series of staples called vervelles.
bascinet	"The illustration to the left shows a bascinet with a type of detachable nasal (nose protector) called the bretache or ""bretèche"" made of sheet metal."
bascinet	"However, from about 1330, the bascinet was often worn with a ""face guard"" or movable visor."
bascinet	One of the early depictions of a doubly pivoted visor on a bascinet is the funerary monument of Sir Hugh Hastings (d. 1347) in St. Mary's Church, Elsing, Norfolk, England.
bascinet	Between c. 1390 and 1410 the bascinet had an exaggeratedly tall skull with an acutely pointed profile – sometimes so severe as to have a near-vertical back.
bascinet	The bascinet fitted with a camail was relatively heavy and most of the weight was supported directly by the head.
bascinet	The lighter types of bascinet gave less protection but allowed greater freedom of movement and better vision.
bascinet	However, Henry V of England is reputed to have worn a great helm over a bascinet at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.
bascinet	Contemporary illustrations show a majority of knights and men-at-arms wearing one of a few variants of the bascinet helmet.
bascinet	The coat of arms seen on the entrance of Saddlers' Hall, showcasing a parlfrey, two horses, a bascinet and the moto, is continued to be used in the Company's communications.
bascinet	On the sandstone slab dedicated to him at Kinkell Kirk, Greenlaw is wearing an open-faced bascinet helmet with a mail-reinforced arming doublet beneath plate armour, and is depicted carrying a hand-and-a-half sword.
bascinet	On the sill of East window, there is an oak effigy of knight in chainmail armour with a pointed bascinet helmet, perhaps depicting Lawrence de Tany, who died in 1317.
bascinet	The orle originated as a functional, padded roll of fabric worn around the bascinet helmet in the 14th century.
bascinet	In this period the bascinet was often worn under a great helm, and the orle served as a padded buffer between the two helmets.
bascinet	The force of any blow received on the great helm would tend to be absorbed by the orle, rather than being directly transmitted to the bascinet and the head within it.
bascinet	Later, certainly before 1400, the bascinet was increasingly worn on its own.
bascinet	In the manuscript depicting the life of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick the earl is described at a tournament wearing a bascinet decorated with a “chapellet rich of perle and precious stones”.
bascinet	Sir Gilbert carries a hand and a half sword and wears an open-faced bascinet helmet with a mail-reinforced arming doublet beneath plate armour.
bascinet	One of the early examples of a doubly pivoted visor on a bascinet is located at the funerary monument Sir Hugh.
trappist	The building of the complex of the Mariastern Abbey in Banja Luka is associated with the arrival of the trappist Franz Pfanner in Bosnia.
trappist	Towards the end of the 19th century, a group of trappist monks were expelled from France and moved to Oka.
trappist	"An expansion of ITA recognized breweries took place for the first time in 2012 when the trappist brewery of the abbey of Engelszell, Trappistenbrauerei Engelszell in Engelhartszell, Austria started brewing beer at the monastery (the former production had stopped in 1929) and in the same year obtained the ""Authentic Trappist Product"" logo for their beer."
trappist	As a greeting, it was used by monks in cistercian and trappist monastic orders in written communication.
trappist	The town has a trappist monastery and is also the home of Sanrio's Harmonyland theme park.
trappist	Educated in a Protestant Christian environment, he was exposed to spiritual aspects of Christianity on a visit to a trappist Catholic monastery.
trappist	William Meninger and Basil Pennington, also trappist monks, were the method's other principal developers.
trappist	Upadhyay was also an influence upon Bede Griffiths., who co-founded Kurisumala Ashram with Belgian trappist Francis Mahieu and who took over leadership of Saccidananda Ashram after Monchanin's death and Le Saux's decision to leave for his hermitage.
trappist	Though Nouwen concluded he was not suited for the trappist life, the Abbey of the Genesee and his relationship with then abbott John Eudes Bamberger continued to be of great importance to him.
trappist	"Beer writer Michael Jackson proposed a five-level scale for serving temperatures: well chilled () for ""light"" beers (pale lagers); chilled () for Berliner Weisse and other wheat beers; lightly chilled () for all dark lagers, altbier and German wheat beers; cellar temperature () for regular British ale, stout and most Belgian specialities; and room temperature () for strong dark ales (especially trappist beer) and barley wine."
trappist	There is now a small community of trappist monks on the site and a small chapel they built by hand, in which they hold mass for Eastern Rite twice weekly.
trappist	"He was released in 1942, initially employed as an ""agricultural worker"", and ending up at the trappist monastery in the St. Norbert neighbourhood of Winnipeg, capital of the mid-western Canadian province of Manitoba."
trappist	He also published the adventures of a Medellin drug trafficker, who left the drug business to become a trappist monk, who was flocking to find a healing miracle.
trappist	"Father Dennis is a trappist monk who presides over the monastery and explains that Orval means ""Golden Valley"" and that the profits from the beer mostly go to people and charities."
trappist	The show flashes back to the Delirium Café where Zane says that trappist beers are non-pasteurized so they contain active yeast which keeps the beer fermenting.
trappist	145 years ago, in a small place beside Banja Luka, beside the Vrbas grove, a brave little Banja Luka brewery was created by the work of a trappist monk from the Marija Zvijezda monastery.
trappist	Popular styles include bock, trappist ale, stout, and wheat beer, though in the 2010s IPA variations became very popular throughout the country, especially in Amsterdam, as the craft brewing industry expanded.
trappist	"Of the twelve trappist breweries, this brewery is currently operated by ""De Koningshoeven NV"", a subsidiary of the Bavaria Brewery, but the buildings and equipment are owned by the abbey."
odometer	Participants would be instructed to religiously follow the mileages on the left of the page to ensure that they were at the correct junction, for which an odometer could be used.
odometer	Dashboard instruments include a speedometer and odometer along with an ammeter and gauges showing water temperature, oil pressure, fuel levels and, separately for each of the two braking circuits, air pressure.
odometer	"The government appealed that decision to an ""en banc"" panel of the circuit, which restored the conviction, holding that the odometer tampering was not ""inherently related"" to the mail fraud."
odometer	On the second question, Blackmun said the court should have considered whether the elements of odometer tampering were a subset of the elements of the mail fraud, and since that was not the case Schmuck had been properly denied the instruction.
odometer	For 15 years, Wayne Schmuck of Harvard, Illinois, owner of Big Foot Auto Sales, had sold used cars he had bought in his state, where vehicle titles did not then require a statement on the title of the odometer reading at the time of the transaction, to dealers in Wisconsin, which did.
odometer	In order for the retail transaction to take place, the dealers needed to mail a title application, including the falsified odometer reading, to the state Department of Transportation.
odometer	"At his trial, presided over by district judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb, he admitted that he had rolled back the odometers, but denied that he had committed mail fraud since the dealers had sent the applications ""after"" they had bought the cars from him, therefore it wasn't necessary that they do so for him to have realized the proceeds of the odometer tampering."
odometer	Before his trial in United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, his attorney, Peter Lewis Steinberg, moved that the jury be instructed that they could convict Schmuck on the lesser included charge of odometer tampering, at the time a misdemeanor, if they did not feel his actions constituted mail fraud.
odometer	"Three years earlier, in ""United States v. Galloway"", a panel of the Seventh Circuit had sustained a mail-fraud conviction in ""United States v. Galloway"", another case involving odometer tampering."
odometer	However, applying the inherent-relationship test, which the circuit had adopted earlier that year, he found that Schmuck was indeed entitled to a jury instruction allowing them to convict on odometer tampering:
odometer	"The facts in all the precedents the majority relied on, even ""Whitaker"", "" demonstrate a much closer relationship between the offense not charged but proved in the course of trial and the offense charged than can be discerned between odometer alteration and mail fraud,"" he wrote."
odometer	"Not only did he reiterate and clarify his earlier opinion to say that ""[g]iven the present indictment, ... alleging as one element devising a scheme to defraud purchasers of automobiles with altered odometers, knowingly and willfully causing an odometer to be altered is not identical to the element of having devised the scheme"", he made an extended critique of the inherent-relationship test."
odometer	Applying the inherent-relationship test to Schmuck's case, Flaum found that the odometer tampering was indeed a lesser charge to the mail fraud.
odometer	"""As the government proved ""this"" case, it ""had"" to prove odometer tampering because tampering led to sale, which led to mailing."""
odometer	But that denial, he continued, was exactly why the jury needed to be able to consider odometer tampering as a lesser included charge.
odometer	"""Because this rational possibility existed based on the record assembled at trial, the defendant was entitled to a lesser instruction on odometer tampering."""
odometer	Only one crime, odometer tampering, corresponded exactly with what Schmuck had done.
odometer	He was interrupted by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wanted him to address the government's argument that the ongoing nature of the fraud made the odometer readings on the title applications essential to the scheme.
odometer	"""There's nothing about title registration which reassures you the odometer hasn't been tampered with."""
odometer	The success of the title applications, he maintained, did not depend on the odometer readings, although Schmuck might have been committing mail fraud if he had mailed the original odometer slips himself.
odometer	"Since Schmuck had admitted to the odometer tampering, ""the only thing the jury could have been out considering was is this really mail fraud."
odometer	"""I think it's clear from that record that a lesser instruction on odometer tampering had at least an arguable chance of success."""
odometer	On rebuttal, Steinberg returned to another point he had been trying to make: that the title-application mailings were actually potentially counterproductive to Schmuck's scheme, since they increased the chance that his odometer alteration would be discovered.
odometer	Noting that since the trial, Congress had made odometer tampering a felony, he implored the justices to stand firm.
odometer	By a narrow margin, it held for the government on both questions, that the title applications were mailings in furtherance of Schmuck's scheme and that he was not entitled to an instruction on odometer tampering.
odometer	"""The three judges of the original appellate panel split in their application of the inherent relationship test to the offenses of mail fraud and odometer tampering,"" Blackmun wrote."
odometer	"""The offense of odometer tampering includes the element of knowingly and willfully causing an odometer to be altered."
odometer	"""Knowingly and willfully tampering with an odometer is not identical to devising or intending to devise a fraudulent scheme."""
odometer	As Steinberg had noted at oral argument, during the pendency of the case Congress had made odometer tampering a felony.
odometer	Beadell's usual method for building roads was to carry out a solo reconnaissance in his Land Rover, bush-bashing through virgin scrub, referring to a magnetic compass for direction, and the vehicle's odometer for distance.

phoropter	"In medicine, particularly optometry, ophthalmology and orthoptics, ""refraction"" (also known as ""refractometry"") is a clinical test in which a phoropter may be used by the appropriate eye care professional to determine the eye's refractive error and the best corrective lenses to be prescribed."
phoropter	A diagnosis of far-sightedness is made by utilizing either a retinoscope or an automated refractor-objective refraction; or trial lenses in a trial frame or a phoropter to obtain a subjective examination.
phoropter	The prescription is typically determined during a refraction, using a phoropter and asking the patient which of two lenses is better, or by automated refractor, or through the technique of retinoscopy.
phoropter	The word entered the language when the instrument for measuring vision was called an optometer, (before the terms phoropter or refractor were used).
phoropter	Adaptic optic phoropter for automated vision correction and Tunable light field camera in use for VR and AR technology
phoropter	Typically, the patient will sit behind a phoropter or wear a trial frame and look at an eye chart.

phoropter	During a refraction, an autorefractor or retinoscope is used to give an initial objective assessment of the refractive status of each eye, then a phoropter is used to subjectively refine the patient's eyeglass prescription.
phoropter	Since most refractions (the measurement that determines the power of a corrective lens) are performed at a vertex distance of 12–14 mm, the power of the correction may need to be modified from the initial prescription so that light reaches the patient's eye with the same effective power that it did through the phoropter or trial frame.
phoropter	A phoropter measurement of a patient reads −8.00D sphere and −5.25D cylinder with an axis of 85° for one eye (the notation for which is typically written as −8 −5.25×85).

subsoiler	A subsoiler or flat lifter is a tractor-mounted farm implement used for deep tillage, loosening and breaking up soil at depths below the levels worked by moldboard ploughs, disc harrows, or rototillers.
subsoiler	Most such tools will break up and turn over surface soil to a depth of , whereas a subsoiler will break up and loosen soil to twice those depths.
subsoiler	The subsoiler is a tillage tool which will improve growth in all crops where soil compaction is a problem.
subsoiler	The subsoiler consists of three or more heavy vertical shanks (standards) mounted on a toolbar or frame with shear bolts.
subsoiler	Typically, a subsoiler mounted on a compact utility tractor will reach depths of about and have only one thin blade with a sharpened tip.
subsoiler	The condition of the points is very important: often the subsoiler fails to give good results due to the condition of its points.
subsoiler	Agricultural subsoiler implements will have multiple deeper-reaching blades; each blade is called a scarifier or shank.
subsoiler	One type of subsoiler has a torpedo-shaped tip and is called a mole plough because the tip describes a path much like the burrow that a mole creates.
subsoiler	For production agriculture, past and present, two-wheel tractors accept a wide range of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters.
subsoiler	The machinery is a form of a subsoiler with a single blade.

monocular	The horse has a wide field of monocular vision, as well as good visual acuity.
monocular	However, because horses have strong monocular vision, it is possible for a horse to position one ear forward and one ear back, indicative of similar divided visual attention.
monocular	"For example, with M. de Saint Rat, Atherton Seidell developed a simple, inexpensive ($2.00 in 1950), monocular microfilm viewing device, known as the ""Seidell viewer"", that was sold during the 1940s and 1950s."

monocular	In 1997 the MRG6 monocular system, priced at $3495, was launched to focus on the wearable computing market.
monocular	It is one of several of his works related to military art and monocular vision.
monocular	"According to art historian Michael Lobel, monocular vision is the motif in which the subject is ""depicted frontally in such a way as to expose both eyes to the viewer, yet which has one eye closed or otherwise obscured"" and not those in which the subject is depicted in profile."
monocular	The work addresses Lichtenstein's motif of monocularity by pitting the pilot's binocular vision against the technologically advanced monocular computing reflector gun sight.
monocular	Persisting blurry or double vision with one eye closed is classified as monocular diplopia.
monocular	Diplopia can also occur when viewing with only one eye; this is called monocular diplopia, or where the patient perceives more than two images, monocular polyopia.
monocular	While serious causes rarely may be behind monocular diplopia symptoms, this is much less often the case than with binocular diplopia.
monocular	Breese also discovered the phenomenon of monocular rivalry: if the two rival stimuli are optically superimposed to the same eye and one fixates on the stimuli, then alternations in the clarity of the two stimuli are seen.
monocular	The AN/PSQ-20 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG) is a third-generation passive monocular night vision device developed for the United States Armed Forces by ITT Exelis.
monocular	The company offers a great variety of stereoscopic and monocular instruments, dedicated to medical, biological, and technical applications, as well as photographic and video accessories.

monocular	Familiar examples include the Necker cube, Schroeder staircase, structure from motion, monocular rivalry, and binocular rivalry, but many more visually ambiguous patterns are known.
monocular	However, in monocular presentations, such as photographs, the elimination of our depth perception causes multistable perception, which can cause the craters to look like plateaus rather than pits.
monocular	"In 1962, Hughes Aircraft Company revealed the Electrocular, a compact CRT(7"" long), head-mounted monocular display that reflected a TV signal in to transparent eyepiece."
monocular	The self-contained color monocular organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display replaces the NVG tube and connects to a mobile computing device.
monocular	As long as the two component stimuli differ spatiotemporally in some way, such as orientation (as shown), spatial frequency, or direction of movement, monocular rivalry can be seen.
monocular	He called it monocular rivalry to distinguish it from binocular rivalry, a similar phenomenon in which the different images are presented to opposite eyes.
monocular	"They called the phenomenon ""monocular pattern alternation"", but Campbell called it monocular rivalry in later papers, and that is the term that has stuck, even though the phenomenon does not require monocular viewing."
monocular	After a burst of research activity in the 1970s, monocular rivalry fell out of favour when Georgeson and Phillips (1980) argued that monocular rivalry arises from afterimages and eye movements.
monocular	Although afterimages and eye movements must contribute to monocular rivalry, they cannot be a complete explanation for at least four reasons: First, it occurs with stimuli other than gratings for which afterimages would not cancel or reinforce the original images (e.g., Sindermann &amp; Lüddeke, 1972).
monocular	In 1997, Andrews and Purves revived interest in monocular rivalry by showing that its alternations could be entrained by binocular rivalry alternations in an adjacent part of the visual field.
monocular	Tscherning (1898) pointed out the similarity of monocular rivalry to binocular rivalry.
monocular	Breese (1899) attributed monocular rivalry to the same mechanism as responsible for binocular rivalry.
monocular	Tree girth may also be measured remotely using a monocular with reticle, through photographic interpretation, or by some electronic surveying instruments.
monocular	Ground-based measurements are obtained by the use of a monocular w/reticle, laser rangefinder, and a clinometer.
monocular	A monocular w/reticle is a small telescope with an internal scale visible through the glass.
monocular	The monocular is mounted on a tripod and the trunk of the tree is sighted through the lens.
monocular	With the distance known, the diameter of the tree measured expressed as units of the reticle scale, and an optical scaling factor for the monocular w/reticle, provided by the manufacturer and calibrated by the user, the diameter of the tree at that point can be calculated:

monocular	537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices.
monocular	"The classic symptom of keratoconus is the perception of multiple ""ghost"" images, known as monocular polyopia."
monocular	"In one study, only 23.8 percent of patients with transient monocular vision loss experienced the classic ""curtain"" or ""shade"" descending over their vision."
monocular	Other descriptions of this experience include a monocular blindness, dimming, fogging, or blurring.
monocular	Certainly, additional symptoms may be present with the amaurosis fugax, and those findings will depend on the cause of the transient monocular vision loss.
monocular	"In 1990, the causes of amaurosis fugax were better refined by the Amaurosis Fugax Study Group, which has defined five distinct classes of transient monocular blindness based on their supposed cause: embolic, hemodynamic, ocular, neurologic, and idiopathic (or ""no cause identified"")."
monocular	With respect to embolic and hemodynamic causes, this transient monocular visual loss ultimately occurs due to a temporary reduction in retinal artery, ophthalmic artery, or ciliary artery blood flow, leading to a decrease in retinal circulation which, in turn, causes retinal hypoxia.
monocular	While, most commonly, emboli causing amaurosis fugax are described as coming from an atherosclerotic carotid artery, any emboli arising from vasculature preceding the retinal artery, ophthalmic artery, or ciliary arteries may cause this transient monocular blindness.
monocular	"Restated, ""because of the brief interval between the transient event and a stroke or blindness from temporal arteritis, the workup for transient monocular blindness should be undertaken without delay."""
monocular	Examples of strong critical periods include monocular deprivation, filial imprinting, monaural occlusion, and Prefrontal Synthesis acquisition.
monocular	Normally, as development progresses, the visual cortex will segregate into monocular columns that receive input from only one eye.
monocular	Neurons who received less frequent input from retinal ganglion cells during early postnatal periods were more prone to be engulfed and pruned by microglia, as per monocular deprivation experiments.
monocular	Motility levels significantly decrease before the start of the visual cortex critical period and monocular deprivation experiments show that motility levels steadily decrease until the critical period is over, hinting that motility might not be explicitly involved in this process.
monocular	For example, PNN digestion by ABC chondroitinase in rats leads to a shift in ocular dominance upon monocular deprivation, which is normally restricted to its critical period much earlier in development.
monocular	A mutation of the Nogo receptor in mice was found to extend the critical period for monocular dominance from around 20 – 32 days to 45 or 120 days, suggesting a likely role of the myelin Nogo receptor in critical period closure.
monocular	For example, on the one hand, in kittens, a shift in ocular dominance resulting from monocular deprivation during the critical period is reduced by combined destruction of noradrenergic and cholinergic neurons.
monocular	This model was important because it was able to describe a strong critical period for the proper development of normal ocular dominance columns in the lateral geniculate nucleus, and thus able to explain the effects of monocular deprivation during this critical period.
monocular	In a similar experiment, Antonini and Stryker (1993) examined the anatomical changes that can be observed after monocular deprivation.
monocular	They found that in the long term, monocular deprivation causes reduced branching at the end of neurons, while the amount of afferents allocated to the nondeprived eye increased.
monocular	Typical symptoms of the disorder include: halos or auras surrounding objects, trails following objects in motion, difficulty distinguishing between colors, apparent shifts in the hue of a given item, the illusion of movement in a static setting, visual snow, distortions in the dimensions of a perceived object, intensified hypnagogic &amp; hypnopompic hallucinations, monocular double vision, seeing an excessive amount of floaters and blue field entopic phenomenon.
monocular	PirB loss of function mutant mice also exhibited enhanced plasticity after monocular deprivation during the critical period.
monocular	After conducting experiments on contrast and lightness induction, interocular induction and induction between spatial frequency bands, they show that lateral inhibitory effect is monocular and adapted only for spatial frequency.
monocular	Orion also sells binoculars for astronomical and terrestrial observing, microscopes and monocular spotting scopes of the type used by birdwatchers and marksmen.

hydrometer	It is not, typically, actually necessary to consult tables as the tabulated °Bx or °P value can be printed directly on the hydrometer scale next to the tabulated value of specific gravity or stored in the memory of the electronic U-tube meter or calculated from polynomial fits to the tabulated data.
hydrometer	"As solutes other than sucrose may affect the refractive index and the specific gravity differently, this refractive ""Brix"" value is not interchangeable with the traditional hydrometer Brix unless corrections are applied."
hydrometer	A hydrometer is used during and after the fermentation process to determine the potential alcohol percentage of the moonshine, whereas an alcoholmeter is used after the product has been distilled to determine the volume percent or proof.
hydrometer	The higher the specific gravity of a solution, the higher the hydrometer floats.
hydrometer	As to the liquid, they sold a cylinder to pour it in, a hydrometer to test it, bottles to fill with it, bottling machines, corks to keep it in along with machines to cut, brand and insert them, capsules to put over top and capsuling machines to do that job, then labels and label gumming machines.
hydrometer	The large London porter breweries pioneered many technological advances, such as the construction of large storage vats, the use of the thermometer (about 1760), the hydrometer (1770), and attemperators (about 1780).
hydrometer	The electrolyte cannot be tested by hydrometer to diagnose improper charging that can reduce battery life.

hyfrecator	The low powered hyfrecator for office use was introduced in 1940.
hyfrecator	The scraping is then paused while an electrosurgical device like a hyfrecator is used next.
hyfrecator	A hyfrecator is a low-powered medical apparatus used in electrosurgery on conscious patients, usually in an office setting.
hyfrecator	"Unlike other types of electrosurgery, the hyfrecator does not employ a dispersive electrode pad that is attached to the patient in an area not being treated, and that leads back to the apparatus (sometimes loosely but not quite correctly called a ""ground pad"")."
hyfrecator	The hyfrecator primarily differs from other electrosurgical devices in that it is low-powered and not intended for cutting tissue, thus enabling its use with conscious patients.
hyfrecator	"The hyfrecator does not require a dispersive return pad, referred-to in the electrosurgery field as a ""ground pad,"" or ""patient plate,"" because the hyfrecator can pass a very low-powered current between forceps tips via bipolar output, or pass an A.C. current between one pointed metal electrode probe and the patient, with the patient's self-capacitance alone providing a current sink--this is equivalent to considering displacement current to be the return current."
hyfrecator	Although the hyfrecator is not used primarily to cut tissue, it may be used in a secondary capacity to control bleeding, after tissue is cut by a standard surgical scalpel, or else it may be used to partly destroy superficial tissue, that is then removed by the scraping action of a curette.

variometer	A variometer is a type of continuously variable air-core RF inductor with two windings.
variometer	The advantage of the variometer is that inductance can be adjusted continuously, over a wide range.
variometer	The pancake coil variometer was another common construction used in both 1920s receivers and transmitters.
variometer	Modern scientific equipment, such as the magnetic variometer method were implemented, from the headquarters of Fen Research Ltd., located at Dovecote Farm in Walpole St. Peter, which had been purposely formed to search for King John's treasure.
variometer	He invented the total energy variometer in 1939, used in soaring planes, and is the co-inventor of an early scheme for magnetically contained nuclear fusion, patent application, 1941.
variometer	The nose does not noticeably drop, but the variometer indicates a high rate of descent and the vibration continues until back pressure is released and stall recovery is initiated.
variometer	The GPS variometer also tracked vertical speeds of up to +20 m/s ().
variometer	This was done by an adjustable air core transformer called a variometer (variocoupler).
variometer	The cockpit interior was newly designed including a self-designed and built flight director / variometer system and parallelogram control input system similar to Glasflügel practice.
variometer	In aviation, a variometer – also known as a rate of climb and descent indicator (RCDI), rate-of-climb indicator, vertical speed indicator (VSI), or vertical velocity indicator (VVI) – is one of the flight instruments in an aircraft used to inform the pilot of the rate of descent or climb.
variometer	"Welch goes on to state that the ""first real thermal soaring"" occurred in 1930 by A. Haller and Wolf Hirth, with Hirth using a variometer in his Musterle."
variometer	"According to Paul MacCready, ""A variometer is essentially a pressure altimeter with a leak which tends to make it read the altitude of a moment earlier."
variometer	The vane variometer consists of a rotating vane, centered by a coil spring, dividing a chamber into two parts, one connected to a static port, and the other to an expansion chamber.
variometer	A simple variometer can be constructed by adding a large reservoir (a thermos bottle) to augment the storage capacity of a common aircraft rate-of-climb instrument.
variometer	Newer variometer designs directly measure the static pressure of the atmosphere using a pressure sensor and detect changes in altitude directly from the change in air pressure instead of by measuring air flow.
variometer	After the variometer was invented in 1929 by Alexander Lippisch and Robert Kronfeld, the sport of gliding moved into a new realm.
variometer	Variometers also became important in foot-launch hang gliding, where the open-to-air pilot hears the wind but needs the variometer to help him or her to detect regions of rising or sinking air.
variometer	But the variometer became key as pilots began making longer flights.
variometer	The first portable variometer for use in hang gliders was the Colver Variometer, introduced in the 1970s by Colver Soaring Instruments, which served to extend the sport into cross-country thermal flying.
variometer	In the 1980s, Ball Variometers Inc., founded in 1971 by Richard Harding Ball (1921–2011), produced a wrist variometer powered by a 9-volt battery.
variometer	"An uncompensated variometer will simply indicate vertical speed of the glider, giving rise to the possibility of a ""stick thermal,"" i.e., a change in altitude caused by stick input only."
variometer	For example, if a pilot pushes forward on the stick, speeding up as the plane dives, an uncompensated variometer only indicates that altitude is being lost.
variometer	A compensated variometer uses both speed and altitude to indicate the change in total energy.
variometer	So the pilot that pushes the stick forward, diving to gain speed, and then pulls back again to regain altitude will notice no change in total energy on a compensated variometer (neglecting energy loss due to drag).
variometer	A second type of compensated variometer is the Netto or airmass variometer.
variometer	In addition to TE compensation, the Netto variometer adjusts for the intrinsic sink rate of the glider at a given speed (the polar curve) adjusted for the wing loading due to water ballast.
variometer	"MacCready stated, ""In still air...a glider has a different sinking speed at each airspeed...it would be nicer if the variometer automatically added the sink rate, and thus showed the vertical air motion instead of the vertical glider motion."
variometer	"As Reichmann explained, a ""Netto variometer shows the climb and sink of airmass (not of the sailplane!"
variometer	"Tom Brandes states, ""Netto is simply the German way of saying 'net,' and a Netto Variometer System (or polar compensator) is simply one that tells you the net vertical air movement with the sailplane movement or sink taken out of the usual variometer reading."""
variometer	When thermalling, the sensor will detect acceleration (gravity plus centrifugal) above 1 g and tell the relative netto variometer to stop subtracting the sailplane's wing load-adjusted polar sink rate for the duration.
variometer	"In 1954, MacCready pointed out the advantages of an Audio Variometer, ""There is much to be gained if the variometer indication is presented to the pilot by sound."
variometer	More than any other instrument except during blind flying, the variometer must be watched continuously.
variometer	Typically the audio tone increases in frequency as the variometer shows a higher rate of climb and decreases in frequency towards a deep groan as the variometer shows a faster rate of descent.
variometer	When the variometer is showing a climb, the tone is often chopped and the rate of chopping may be increased as the climb rate increases, while during a descent the tone is not chopped.
variometer	"A variometer that produces this type of audible tone is known as an ""audio variometer""."
variometer	There is an increasing trend for advanced variometers in gliders towards flight computers (with variometer indications) which can also present information such as controlled airspace, lists of turnpoints and even collision warnings.
variometer	Each variometer system consists of a radio transmitter in the glider, and a receiver on the ground for use by the pilot.
variometer	The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a variometer that quickly indicates climbs and descents.
variometer	"Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their average speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers, or use a ""McCready ring"", a rotatable bezel on the glider's variometer to indicate the best speed to fly."
variometer	Also, nearly every glider contains an instrument known as a variometer (a very sensitive vertical speed indicator) which shows visually (and often audibly) the presence of lift and sink.
variometer	The variometer indicates climb rate or sink rate with audio signals (beeps) and/or a visual display.
variometer	The main purpose of a variometer is in helping a pilot find and stay in the 'core' of a thermal to maximize height gain, and conversely indicating when he or she is in sinking air and needs to find rising air.
variometer	"The main purpose of a variometer is in helping a pilot find and stay in the ""core"" of a thermal to maximise height gain and, conversely, to indicate when a pilot is in sinking air and needs to find rising air."
variometer	A variometer indicates climb rate (or sink-rate) with short audio signals (beeps, which increase in pitch and tempo during ascent, and a droning sound, which gets deeper as the rate of descent increases) and/or a visual display.
variometer	Instrumentation was generous, including a variometer though lacking an artificial horizon for cloud flying.
variometer	The RRG Professor was a very early soaring glider and the first to use a variometer for finding thermals.
variometer	At about the same time Alexander Lippisch, who had earlier worked at Dornier on Zeppelins was considering the application of the variometer to gliding.
variometer	"According to Bob Wander, ""The principal advantage of making a rotatable speed-to-fly ring for your total energy variometer is that cross-country speeds in gliding can be optimized when we factor the strength of thermals into the speed-to-fly process."
variometer	On the speed ring, the variometer needle points to the optimum speed to fly between thermals.

manipulator	A parallel manipulator is a mechanical system that uses several computer-controlled serial chains to support a single platform, or end-effector.
manipulator	Perhaps, the best known parallel manipulator is formed from six linear actuators that support a movable base for devices such as flight simulators.
manipulator	Also known as parallel robots, or generalized Stewart platforms (in the Stewart platform, the actuators are paired together on both the basis and the platform), these systems are articulated robots that use similar mechanisms for the movement of either the robot on its base, or one or more manipulator arms.
manipulator	A parallel manipulator is designed so that each chain is usually short, simple and can thus be rigid against unwanted movement, compared to a serial manipulator.
manipulator	It is this closed-loop stiffness that makes the overall parallel manipulator stiff relative to its components, unlike the serial chain that becomes progressively less rigid with more components.
manipulator	A further advantage of the parallel manipulator is that the heavy actuators may often be centrally mounted on a single base platform, the movement of the arm taking place through struts and joints alone.
manipulator	"A manipulator can move an object with up to 6 degrees of freedom (DoF), determined by 3 translation ""3T"" and 3 rotation ""3R"" coordinates for full ""3T3R m""obility."

chronophone	It combined a chronophone sound recording with a chronograph film shot with actors lip-synching to the sound recording.
electroscope	He used an electroscope to show that there was no electric charge present on the inside of the room's walls.
electroscope	This effect is highlighted and measured with a device created by Hurmuzescu - the electroscope that bears his name.
electroscope	In 1903, Henri Becquerel used the Hurmuzescu electroscope in Nobel Prize-awarded radioactivity research.
electroscope	The electroscope is first discharged, and a charged object is then brought close to the instrument's top terminal.
electroscope	The electroscope has not acquired a net charge: the charge within it has merely been redistributed, so if the charged object were to be moved away from the electroscope the leaves will come together again.
electroscope	But if an electrical contact is now briefly made between the electroscope terminal and ground, for example by touching the terminal with a finger, this causes charge to flow from ground to the terminal, attracted by the charge on the object close to the terminal.
electroscope	The electroscope now contains a net charge opposite in polarity to that of the charged object.
electroscope	by lifting the finger, the extra charge that has just flowed into the electroscope cannot escape, and the instrument retains a net charge.
electroscope	The charge is held in the top of the electroscope terminal by the attraction of the inducing charge.
electroscope	But when the inducing charge is moved away, the charge is released and spreads throughout the electroscope terminal to the leaves, so the gold leaves move apart again.
electroscope	The sign of the charge left on the electroscope after grounding is always opposite in sign to the external inducing charge.
electroscope	The electroscope is an early scientific instrument used to detect the presence of electric charge on a body.
electroscope	The accumulation of enough charge to detect with an electroscope requires hundreds or thousands of volts, so electroscopes are used with high voltage sources such as static electricity and electrostatic machines.
electroscope	An electroscope can only give a rough indication of the quantity of charge; an instrument that measures electric charge quantitatively is called an electrometer.
electroscope	"The first electroscope was a pivoted needle (called the ""versorium""), invented by British physician William Gilbert around 1600."
electroscope	The pith-ball electroscope and the gold-leaf electroscope are two classical types of electroscope that are still used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of electrostatics.
electroscope	A type of electroscope is also used in the quartz fiber radiation dosimeter.
electroscope	Tiberius Cavallo made an electroscope in 1770 with pith balls at the end of silver wires.
electroscope	Often the electroscope will have a pair of suspended pith balls.
electroscope	The gold-leaf electroscope was developed in 1787 by British clergyman and physicist Abraham Bennet, as a more sensitive instrument than pith ball or straw blade electroscopes then in use.
electroscope	The electroscope leaves can also be charged without touching a charged object to the terminal, by electrostatic induction.
electroscope	As the charged object is brought near the electroscope terminal, the leaves spread apart, because the electric field from the object induces a charge in the conductive electroscope rod and leaves, and the charged leaves repel each other.
electroscope	If the electroscope is grounded while the charged object is nearby, by touching it momentarily with a finger, the repelled same-sign charges travel through the contact to ground, leaving the electroscope with a net charge having the opposite sign as the object.
electroscope	The catcher was attached to an electroscope to measure its charge.
electroscope	The electroscope showed a negative charge, proving that cathode rays really carry negative electricity.
electroscope	Their higher-elevation experiment site was Tulainyo Lake, where the men carried equipment by mule and paddled out in a faltboot in early September and attached the electroscope to a buoy, where it remained for several days.
electroscope	It had been observed that an electroscope in a vessel at earth potential gradually lost its charge, even if very carefully insulated, due to the ionization of the air.
electroscope	Abraham Bennet, the inventor of the gold-leaf electroscope and developer of an improved magnetometer.
electroscope	"The museum includes a collection of laboratory equipment, among which an electroscope with ""Pierre Curie"" engraved."
electroscope	The galvanometer was made possible in 1820 by the discovery by Hans Christian Ørsted that electric currents would deflect a compass needle, and the gold-leaf electroscope was even earlier (Abraham Bennet, 1786).

thermal cycler	The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to achieve the temperatures required at each step of the reaction (see below).
thermal cycler	A substance marked with a fluorophore is added to this mixture in a thermal cycler that contains sensors for measuring the fluorescence of the fluorophore after it has been excited at the required wavelength allowing the generation rate to be measured for one or more specific products.
thermal cycler	Real-time PCR is carried out in a thermal cycler with the capacity to illuminate each sample with a beam of light of at least one specified wavelength and detect the fluorescence emitted by the excited fluorophore.
thermal cycler	The thermal cycler is also able to rapidly heat and chill samples, thereby taking advantage of the physicochemical properties of the nucleic acids and DNA polymerase.
thermal cycler	The PCR tubes are then placed in a thermal cycler to begin cycling.

thermal cycler	It combines the functions of a thermal cycler and a fluorimeter, enabling the process of quantitative PCR.
thermal cycler	The thermal cycler (also known as a thermocycler, PCR machine or DNA amplifier) is a laboratory apparatus most commonly used to amplify segments of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
thermal cycler	Despite the selling point that HDA negates the use of a thermal cycler and therefore allows research to be conducted in the field, much of the work required to detect potentially hazardous microorganisms is carried out in a research/hospital lab setting regardless.
thermal cycler	At present, mass diagnoses from a great number of samples cannot yet be achieved by HDA, whereas PCR reactions carried out in thermal cycler that can hold multi-well sample plates allows for the amplification and detection of the intended DNA target from a maximum of 96 samples.
thermal cycler	One early example is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which is able to amplify DNA strands using a thermal cycler to micromanage DNA synthesis by adjusting temperature using a pre-made computer program.
thermal cycler	A typical thermal cycler protocol oscillates between 37 °C (optimal for restriction enzymes) and 16 °C (optimal for ligases) many times.
thermal cycler	Hence, fluorescence detected in the quantitative PCR thermal cycler is directly proportional to the fluorophore released and the amount of DNA template present in the PCR.

ampere balance	The ampere balance (also current balance or Kelvin balance) is an electromechanical apparatus used for the precise measurement of the SI unit of electric current, the ampere.
ampere balance	The main weakness of the ampere balance is that the calculation of the current involves the dimensions of the coils.
ampere balance	Thus, the centi-ampere balance ranges from 1 to 100 centi-amperes, the deci-ampere balance from 1 to 100 deci-amperes, the ampere balance from 1 to 100 amperes, etc.
ampere balance	As the international ampere was usually realized by means of an ampere balance rather than electrolytically, 1 Aint = 1 A.

sound level meter	Team owner Billy Sullivan decided to put the new logo up to a vote against Pat Patriot with the fans at the September 23 home game against the San Diego Chargers, using a sound level meter to judge the crowd's reaction.
sound level meter	Even though the level of live music measured on a (slow responding and RMS reading) sound level meter might be in the region of 100 dB SPL, programme level peaks on percussion will far exceed this.
sound level meter	Noise may be measured using a sound level meter at the source of the noise.
sound level meter	Acoustical measurements and instrumentation range from a handheld sound level meter to a 1000-microphone phased array.
sound level meter	The ML1 handheld audio analyzer, AL1 sound level meter and acoustic analyzer and DL1 digital audio analyzer instruments were then added to the product range.
sound level meter	During the calibration process, the output signal from the audiometer to the headphones is measured with a sound level meter to ensure that the signal is accurate to the reading on the audiometer for sound pressure level and frequency.
sound level meter	This type of survey is normally completed using a sound level meter (SLM).
sound level meter	A sound level meter takes a measurement of the sound present in the environment at that moment.
sound level meter	The sound level meter is useless for properly assessing noise levels, since the commonly used A-weighting is based on equal-loudness contours for pure tones, and is not valid for the random noise.
sound level meter	A sound level meter (also called sound pressure level meter (SPL)) is used for acoustic measurements.
sound level meter	The current international standard that specifies sound level meter functionality and performances is the IEC 61672-1:2013.
sound level meter	However, the reading from a sound level meter does not correlate well to human-perceived loudness, which is better measured by a loudness meter.
sound level meter	In 1980, Britain's Cirrus Research introduced the world's first handheld sound level meter to provide integrated and sound exposure level (SEL) measurements.
sound level meter	"The standard sound level meter can be called an ""exponentially averaging sound level meter"" as the AC signal from the microphone is converted to DC by a root-mean-square (RMS) circuit and thus it must have a time constant of integration; today referred to as the time-weighting."
sound level meter	A common variant of the sound level meter is a noise dosemeter (dosimeter in American English).
sound level meter	A noise dosimeter (American) or noise dosemeter (British) is a specialized sound level meter intended specifically to measure the noise exposure of a person integrated over a period of time; usually to comply with Health and Safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure Standard or EU Directive 2003–10/EC.
sound level meter	This applies to both the sound level meter itself as well as the associated calibrator.
sound level meter	For compliance purposes, readings with an ANSI Type 2 sound level meter and dosimeter are considered to have an accuracy of ±2 dBA, while a Type 1 instrument has an accuracy of ±1 dBA.
sound level meter	For Measurements it's important to what frequency weighting effects (how the sound level meter responds to different sound frequencies), and time weighting (how the sound level meter reacts to changes in sound pressure)
sound level meter	The alternative method, which is to generate a time history by storing and displaying samples of the exponential sound level, displays too many artifacts of the sound level meter to be as valuable and such sampled data cannot be readily combined to form an overall set of data.
sound level meter	'Max sound pressure level' is simply the highest RMS reading a conventional sound level meter gives over a stated period for a given time-weighting (S, F, or I) and can be many decibels less than the peak value.
sound level meter	This makes it unlikely that a sound level meter designed to the older 60651 and 60804 standards will meet the requirements of IEC 61672 : 2013.
sound level meter	"A problem in selecting a sound level meter is ""How do you know if it complies with its claimed standard?"""
sound level meter	Even the most accurate approved sound level meter must be regularly checked for sensitivity—what most people loosely call 'calibration'.
sound level meter	The output of the generator is fed to a transducer in a half-inch cavity into which the sound level meter microphone is inserted.
sound level meter	For a complete sound level meter check, periodic testing outlined in IEC61672.3-2013 should be carried out.
sound level meter	These tests excite the sound level meter across the entire frequency and dynamic range ensuring compliance with expected design goals defined in IEC61672.1-2013.
sound level meter	Such monitoring stations are typically based on a sound level meter at the heart and some added capabilities such as remote communication, GPS, and weather stations.
sound level meter	To calibrate the sound level meter apps one must use an acoustical calibrator rather than relying on the pre-defined profiles.
sound level meter	Healthy Hearing, an organization dedicated to hearing health, reported on the top smartphone sound level meter apps: NIOSH Sound Level Meter, Decibel X, and Too Noisy Pro.
sound level meter	In the room below or adjacent, a sound level meter is used to measure the sound level created by the impacts.
sound level meter	"A noise dosimeter (American English) or noise dosemeter (British English) is a specialized sound level meter intended specifically to measure the noise exposure of a person integrated over a period of time; usually to comply with Health and Safety regulations such as the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure Standard or EU Directive 2003/10/EC.&lt;ref name=""EU2003/10/EC""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;"
sound level meter	These were the most common way of making measurements to meet legislation in the USA, but in Europe, the conventional sound level meter was favoured.
sound level meter	By the time the PSEM standard was published, many major sound level meter companies – in both Europe and the USA had a dosimeter in their range.
sound level meter	This allows the sound level meter to determine what decibel level the incoming sound would likely be for a normal hearing human's auditory system.
sound level meter	Whether using a sound level meter or a noise dosimeter, the processing is somewhat similar.
sound level meter	There are many different varieties of instruments that are used to measure noise - Noise Dosimeters are often used in occupational environments, noise monitors are used to measure environmental noise and noise pollution, and recently smartphone-based sound level meter applications (apps) are being used to crowdsource and map recreational and community noise.
sound level meter	This change was needed as each sound level meter manufacturer could choose their own low and high frequency cut-offs (–3 dB) points, resulting in different readings, especially when peak sound level was being measured.
sound level meter	Winner is chosen via a sound level meter (in a live match) or voting (online).
sound level meter	Also, sound level may be metered on several ways: average, maximum level (with the sound level meter set to Fast, Slow, Impulse, or Peak), etc.
sound level meter	"Seattle, WA {Section 25.08.501} considers the sound emitted to be in violation if the sound is ""plainly audible"" within a dwelling from 10 pm to 7am; the need for a sound level meter is avoided."
sound level meter	Measurement is made using a sound level meter with appropriate statistical averaging and corrections to predict the level of sound presented to a human listener.
