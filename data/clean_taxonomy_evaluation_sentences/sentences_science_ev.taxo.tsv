DNA	"""Genome organization"" can also refer to the 3D structure of chromosomes and the positioning of DNA sequences within the nucleus."
DNA	"However, the ratio of coding to noncoding and repetitive sequences is indicative of the complexity of the genome: The largely ""open"" genomes of unicellular fungi have relatively little noncoding DNA compared with the highly heterochromatic genomes of multicellular organisms."
DNA	In particular, mammals have accumulated considerable repetitive elements and noncoding regions, which account for the majority of their DNA sequences (52% non-coding and 44% repetitive DNA).
DNA	This massive expansion of repetitive and noncoding sequences in multicellular organisms is most likely due to the incorporation of invasive elements, such as DNA transposons, retrotransposons, and other repetitive elements.
DNA	This results in transcription units that are frequently much larger (30–200 kb), commonly containing multiple promoters and DNA repeats within untranslated introns.
DNA	The vast expansion of the genome with noncoding and repetitive DNA in higher eukaryotes implies more extensive epigenetic silencing mechanisms.

stem cell	The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two properties:
stem cell	Two mechanisms ensure that a stem cell population is maintained (doesn't shrink in size):
stem cell	Asymmetric cell division: a stem cell divides into one mother cell, which is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell, which is differentiated.
stem cell	When a stem cell self-renews, it divides and does not disrupt the undifferentiated state.
stem cell	Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell grows and divides into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes mitosis and produces two stem cells identical to the original.
stem cell	It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

linguistics	the branch of linguistics which studies all languages and aims at developing a general theory of language.
linguistics	"IL is opposed to basic assumptions that characterize linguistic cognitivism in its 'non-intentionalist' varieties: the objects of linguistics are construed not as mental or neurophysiological mechanisms or corresponding 'representations,' but as natural languages conceived as abstract, extramental entities; a grammar of a language is an empirical theory (ideally, an empirical axiomatic theory) of that language, in a sense of 'theory' that requires sets of statements among the theory's components&lt;ref name=""Lieb 1974a/1976c""&gt;Lieb, Hans-Heinrich."
linguistics	Given these characteristics, the common but rather constrained distinction between 'formalist,' 'functionalist,' and 'cognitivist' schools of linguistics does not apply to IL, which exhibits features of all three kinds of approaches.

thermodynamics	Atmospheric thermodynamics is the study of heat-to-work transformations (and their reverse) that take place in the earth's atmosphere and manifest as weather or climate.
thermodynamics	Atmospheric thermodynamics use the laws of classical thermodynamics, to describe and explain such phenomena as the properties of moist air, the formation of clouds, atmospheric convection, boundary layer meteorology, and vertical instabilities in the atmosphere.
thermodynamics	Atmospheric thermodynamics forms a basis for cloud microphysics and convection parameterizations used in numerical weather models and is used in many climate considerations, including convective-equilibrium climate models.
thermodynamics	Atmospheric thermodynamics describes the effect of buoyant forces that cause the rise of less dense (warmer) air, the descent of more dense air, and the transformation of water from liquid to vapor (evaporation) and its condensation.
thermodynamics	The major role of atmospheric thermodynamics is expressed in terms of adiabatic and diabatic forces acting on air parcels included in primitive equations of air motion either as grid resolved or subgrid parameterizations.
thermodynamics	These sorts of foundations naturally began to be applied towards the development of theoretical models of atmospheric thermodynamics which drew the attention of the best minds.
thermodynamics	Papers on atmospheric thermodynamics appeared in the 1860s that treated such topics as dry and moist adiabatic processes.
thermodynamics	"Pseudo-adiabatic process was coined by von Bezold describing air as it is lifted, expands, cools, and eventually precipitates its water vapor; in 1888 he published voluminous work entitled ""On the thermodynamics of the atmosphere""."

thermodynamics	Carnot's work attracted little attention during his lifetime, but it was later used by Rudolf Clausius and Lord Kelvin to formalize the second law of thermodynamics and define the concept of entropy.
thermodynamics	In 1824 the principle of conservation of energy was still poorly developed and controversial, and an exact formulation of the first law of thermodynamics was still more than a decade away; the mechanical equivalence of heat would not be formulated for another two decades.
thermodynamics	Perhaps the most important contribution Carnot made to thermodynamics was his abstraction of the essential features of the steam engine, as they were known in his day, into a more general and idealized heat engine.

thermodynamics	Diesel understood thermodynamics and the theoretical and practical constraints on fuel efficiency.
thermodynamics	The laws of thermodynamics predicted that, since polywater had a higher boiling point than ordinary water, it meant it was more stable, and thus all of Earth's water should have turned spontaneously into polywater, instead of just part of it.

thermodynamics	Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines, particularly through the work of French physicist Sadi Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic Wars.
thermodynamics	"Scots-Irish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854 which stated, ""Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency."""
thermodynamics	The initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines was quickly extended to the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions.
thermodynamics	Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field.
thermodynamics	A description of any thermodynamic system employs the four laws of thermodynamics that form an axiomatic basis.
thermodynamics	With these tools, thermodynamics can be used to describe how systems respond to changes in their environment.
thermodynamics	The results of thermodynamics are essential for other fields of physics and for chemistry, chemical engineering, corrosion engineering, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, cell biology, biomedical engineering, materials science, and economics, to name a few.
thermodynamics	This article is focused mainly on classical thermodynamics which primarily studies systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.
thermodynamics	Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is often treated as an extension of the classical treatment, but statistical mechanics has brought many advances to that field.
thermodynamics	The history of thermodynamics as a scientific discipline generally begins with Otto von Guericke who, in 1650, built and designed the world's first vacuum pump and demonstrated a vacuum using his Magdeburg hemispheres.
thermodynamics	The first and second laws of thermodynamics emerged simultaneously in the 1850s, primarily out of the works of William Rankine, Rudolf Clausius, and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin).
thermodynamics	The foundations of statistical thermodynamics were set out by physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, Max Planck, Rudolf Clausius and J. Willard Gibbs.
thermodynamics	Classical thermodynamics is the description of the states of thermodynamic systems at near-equilibrium, that uses macroscopic, measurable properties.
thermodynamics	Statistical mechanics, also known as statistical thermodynamics, emerged with the development of atomic and molecular theories in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and supplemented classical thermodynamics with an interpretation of the microscopic interactions between individual particles or quantum-mechanical states.
thermodynamics	This field relates the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic, bulk properties of materials that can be observed on the human scale, thereby explaining classical thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and quantum theory at the microscopic level.
thermodynamics	Chemical thermodynamics is the study of the interrelation of energy with chemical reactions or with a physical change of state within the confines of the laws of thermodynamics.
thermodynamics	The primary objective of chemical thermodynamics is determining the spontaneity of a given transformation.
thermodynamics	Equilibrium thermodynamics is the study of transfers of matter and energy in systems or bodies that, by agencies in their surroundings, can be driven from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another.
thermodynamics	A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial equilibrium state, and given its surroundings, and given its constitutive walls, to calculate what will be the final equilibrium state of the system after a specified thermodynamic operation has changed its walls or surroundings.
thermodynamics	Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium.
thermodynamics	In the various theoretical descriptions of thermodynamics these laws may be expressed in seemingly differing forms, but the most prominent formulations are the following.
thermodynamics	"The zeroth law of thermodynamics states: ""If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other."""
thermodynamics	"The first law of thermodynamics states: ""In a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy,"" formula_1"", of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat,"" formula_2"", less the thermodynamic work,"" formula_3"", done by the system on its surroundings."""
thermodynamics	"A traditional version of the second law of thermodynamics states: ""Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body."""
thermodynamics	For systems that are initially far from thermodynamic equilibrium, though several have been proposed, there is known no general physical principle that determines the rates of approach to thermodynamic equilibrium, and thermodynamics does not deal with such rates.
thermodynamics	"The third law of thermodynamics states: ""As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value."""
thermodynamics	This law of thermodynamics is a statistical law of nature regarding entropy and the impossibility of reaching absolute zero of temperature.
thermodynamics	An important concept in thermodynamics is the thermodynamic system, which is a precisely defined region of the universe under study.
thermodynamics	Generally, thermodynamics distinguishes three classes of systems, defined in terms of what is allowed to cross their boundaries:
thermodynamics	The central concept of thermodynamics is that of energy, the ability to do work.
thermodynamics	Axiomatic thermodynamics is a mathematical discipline that aims to describe thermodynamics in terms of rigorous axioms, for example by finding a mathematically rigorous way to express the familiar laws of thermodynamics.
thermodynamics	"The first attempt at an axiomatic theory of thermodynamics was Constantin Carathéodory's 1909 work ""Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics"", which made use of Pfaffian systems and the concept of adiabatic accessibility, a notion that was introduced by Carathéodory himself."
thermodynamics	For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.
thermodynamics	These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, and special relativity.
thermodynamics	Heat is a form of energy, the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy.
thermodynamics	Statistical mechanics develop the phenomenological results of thermodynamics from a probabilistic examination of the underlying microscopic systems.
thermodynamics	Statistical mechanics provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life, therefore explaining thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics at the microscopic level.
thermodynamics	It uses and extends concepts from thermodynamics and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.
thermodynamics	"Then, the thermodynamics of this century, by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Gibbs and others, established the ""system"" reference model as a formal scientific object."
thermodynamics	At the same time, Howard T. Odum, known as a radiation ecologist, recognized that the study of general systems required a language that could depict energetics, thermodynamics and kinetics at any system scale.
thermodynamics	), radiometry (langley, jansky), photometry (phot, nox, stilb, nit, metre-candle,:17 lambert, apostilb, skot, brill, troland, talbot, candlepower, candle), thermodynamics (calorie), and spectroscopy (reciprocal centimetre).
thermodynamics	He argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete, a theory that was valid but not fundamental, analogous to how thermodynamics is valid, but the fundamental theory behind it is statistical mechanics.
thermodynamics	"For positive ""J""0 the thermodynamics of the Mattis spin glass corresponds in fact simply to a ""ferromagnet in disguise"", just because these systems have no ""frustration"" at all."
thermodynamics	The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy).
thermodynamics	"This has led scientists to use tetrominoes ""as a proxy for molecules with a complex shape"" to model their ""adsorption on a flat surface"" to study the thermodynamics of nanoparticles."
thermodynamics	Thermochemistry coalesces the concepts of thermodynamics with the concept of energy in the form of chemical bonds.
thermodynamics	These statements preceded the first law of thermodynamics (1845) and helped in its formulation.
thermodynamics	While classical thermodynamics is primarily concerned with thermodynamic equilibrium, statistical mechanics has been applied in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to the issues of microscopically modeling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances.
thermodynamics	The primary goal of statistical thermodynamics (also known as equilibrium statistical mechanics) is to derive the classical thermodynamics of materials in terms of the properties of their constituent particles and the interactions between them.
thermodynamics	In other words, statistical thermodynamics provides a connection between the macroscopic properties of materials in thermodynamic equilibrium, and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the material.
thermodynamics	(Statistical thermodynamics can only be used to calculate the final result, after the external imbalances have been removed and the ensemble has settled back down to equilibrium.)
thermodynamics	The second principle of thermodynamics has implications on the sign of some thermodynamic properties such isothermal compressibility.
thermodynamics	Furthermore, elementary mode analysis takes into account stoichiometrics and thermodynamics when evaluating whether a particular metabolic route or network is feasible and likely for a set of proteins/enzymes.
thermodynamics	From the second law of thermodynamics it can be demonstrated that no system can ever be 100% efficient.
thermodynamics	Neither the first nor the second law of thermodynamics includes a measure of the rate of energy transformation.
thermodynamics	"The second law of thermodynamics as stated by Carathéodory essentially amounts to the statement that heat is a holonomic process function since the integrating factor ""λ"""
