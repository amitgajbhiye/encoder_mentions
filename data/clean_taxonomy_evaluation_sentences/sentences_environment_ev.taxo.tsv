noise	The noise is generated by the fluctuating velocity and pressure fields within this TBL.
noise	For an acoustic signal to be detected easily, it must exceed the reverberation level as well as the background noise level.
noise	Sometimes the frequency of the radiated noise (a tonal) may also be known, in which case the same calculation can be done for passive sonar.
noise	Ambient noise is that part of the received noise that is independent of the source, receiver and platform characteristics.
noise	The background noise present in the ocean, or ambient noise, has many different sources and varies with location and frequency.
noise	At the lowest frequencies, from about 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, ocean turbulence and microseisms are the primary contributors to the noise background.
noise	Typical noise spectrum levels decrease with increasing frequency from about 140 dB re 1 μPa2/Hz at 1 Hz to about 30 dB re 1 μPa2/Hz at 100 kHz.
noise	Distant ship traffic is one of the dominant noise sources in most areas for frequencies of around 100 Hz, while wind-induced surface noise is the main source between 1 kHz and 30 kHz.
noise	At very high frequencies, above 100 kHz, thermal noise of water molecules begins to dominate.

noise	Sirocco was testing many aspects of projected- versus actual operating costs; dispatch reliability; noise and emissions levels; and component wear and tear among many other things.
noise	Balanced lines work because the interfering noise from the surrounding environment induces equal noise voltages into both wires.
noise	By measuring the voltage difference between the two wires at the receiving end, the original signal is recovered while the noise is rejected.
noise	Any inequality in the noise induced in each wire is an imbalance and will result in the noise not being fully rejected.
noise	One requirement for balance is that both wires are an equal distance from the noise source.
noise	If one wire has a higher impedance to ground it will tend to have a higher noise induced, destroying the balance.
noise	The line and circuit remain balanced, and the benefits of common-mode noise rejection continue to apply, whether or not the applied signal is itself balanced (symmetrical), always provided that the generator producing that signal maintains the impedance balance of the line.
noise	In all methods, for the continued benefit of good noise immunity, it is essential that the driving and receiving circuit maintain the impedance balance of the line.
noise	The receiving amplifier still rejects any common-mode noise as it has a differential input.

noise	A LISN is a low-pass filter typically placed between an AC or DC power source and the EUT (equipment under test) to create a known impedance and to provide a radio frequency (RF) noise measurement port.
noise	The main function of a LISN is to provide a precise impedance to the power input of the EUT, in order to get repeatable measurements of the EUT noise present at the LISN measurement port.
noise	Another important function of a LISN is to prevent the high-frequency noise of the power source from coupling in the system.
noise	A LISN functions as a low-pass filter, which provides high impedance to the outside RF noise while allowing the low-frequency power to flow through to the EUT.
noise	The stabilized impedance, the built-in low-pass filter function, and the DC rejection properties of the LISN measurement port makes it easy to couple the high frequency noise signal to the input of the measuring equipment.

ozone	Ground-level ozone (O3), when in high concentrations, is regarded as an air pollutant and is often found in smog in industrial areas.
ozone	There is limited research pertaining to the effect that ozone pollution does have on fertility.
ozone	At present, there is no evidence to suggest that ozone exposure poses a deleterious effect on spontaneous fertility in either females or males.
ozone	However, there have been studies which suggest that high levels of ozone pollution (often a problem in the summer months) do exert an effect on in vitro fertilisation (IVF) outcomes.
ozone	In fact, within an IVF population, NOx and ozone pollutants were linked with reduced rates of live birth.
ozone	Therefore, ozone pollution is considered to have a negative impact on the success of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) when occurring at high levels.

monkey	Among the stages in the process are the earthworm, the monkey and the cave man.
monkey	"That the earthworm is transformed into a monkey and not into another animal might indicate that the thesis of a kinship between ape and human received a wider acceptance among the British public (""The Descent of Man"" had been published 10 years earlier)."
monkey	Still, the monkey is depicted as the underdeveloped version of a human.
monkey	The monkey is now only depicted as the underdeveloped stage of the human and does not function as the caricature of human behaviour any more.

insect	[1] A trap crop is used for attracting the insect and pests away from the field.
insect	In a review of 100 trap cropping examples in 2006, only 10 trap crops were classified as successful at a commercial scale, and in all successful cases, trap cropping was supplemented with management practices that specifically limited insect dispersal from the trap crop back into the main crop.
insect	Planting crops in rows helps facilitate supplemental management practices that prevent insect pest dispersal back into the main field, such as driving a vehicle above the trap crop which then removes insect pests by vacuuming them off of the trap crop row or targeted insecticides, which are only deployed on the trap crop.
insect	Other strategies that prevent dispersal of insect pests back into the main crop include cutting the trap plants, applying predators to the trap plant that eat the pest, and planting a high ratio of trap plants to other plants.
insect	This induces the insect to try to land on the plant it seeks.
insect	The second phase of host-plant finding is for the insect to make short flights from leaf to leaf to assess the plant's overall suitability.
insect	The number of leaf-to-leaf flights varies according to the insect species and to the host-plant stimulus received from each leaf.
insect	"But the insect must accumulate sufficient stimuli from the host-plant to lay eggs; so it must make a certain number of consecutive ""appropriate"" landings."
insect	"Hence if it makes an ""inappropriate landing"", the assessment of that plant is negative and the insect must start the process anew."
insect	Thus, a clover ground cover was shown to have the same disruptive effect on eight pest species from four insect orders.
insect	When population of bacteria increases it re-emerges to the surface and is transmitted mainly by wind, rain or through seeds or agricultural machinery, while animal and insect vectors seems to play minor role.

Arctic	Rupert Nigel Pendrill Hadow known as Pen Hadow (British, born 26 February 1962), is an Arctic region explorer, advocate, adventurer and guide.
Arctic	Hadow led the multi-award-winning £6.5m international research programme, Catlin Arctic Survey (2007-2012) which investigated sea ice volume, ocean acidification and ocean circulation.
Arctic	He accepted a World Technology Network Award (Environment) on behalf of the Catlin Arctic Survey team in New York (2009); and along with Ann Daniels and Martin Hartley (expedition team members on the 2009 survey), he was declared a ‘Hero of the Environment’ by TIME magazine for his team's work.
Arctic	In summer 2017, he led Arctic Mission, which became the first boat expedition without icebreakers to sail into the ice-free international waters surrounding the North Geographic Pole.
Arctic	In 1995 he set up The Polar Travel Company offering guided expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic, and most notably the North Geographic Pole.
Arctic	"The expedition, known as the ""Catlin Arctic Survey"" after lead sponsor Catlin Group Limited, an international speciality insurance and reinsurance company, covered 430 km in 73 days, with Hadow accompanied by Arctic explorer, Ann Daniels, and photographer Martin Hartley."
Arctic	The Survey's observations, viewed in the context of decades of existing measurements by submarines, satellites and buoys, led Professor Peter Wadhams of the Polar Ocean Physics Group (University of Cambridge) to suggest the Survey's work added further evidence to an emerging view that there is a significant probability that by 2020 only 20% of the Arctic Ocean basin will have sea ice cover in the late summer.
Arctic	Professor Wadhams also suggested that by 2030–40, there is a significant probability that the Arctic Ocean's sea ice cover will be transformed into an ice-free open ocean in summer times.

Arctic	The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS), established in 1913, has a long history of classing icebreakers and ice-strengthened vessels, and today maintains its own set of ice class rules for vessels navigating in freezing non-Arctic and Arctic seas.
Arctic	Out of about 5,000 vessels classified by the RS, over 3,200 are strengthened for navigation in ice and 300 of these have an ice class intended for operations in Arctic waters.
Arctic	, the ice classes are divided to non-Arctic, Arctic and icebreaker classes.
Arctic	"The ice class notation is followed by a number which denotes the level of ice strengthening: ""Ice1"" to ""Ice3"" for non-Arctic ships, ""Arc4"" to ""Arc9"" for Arctic ships, and ""Icebreaker6"" to ""Icebreaker9"" for icebreakers."

rodent	While it has yet to have been studied in-depth in the human brain, the SVZ function in the rodent brain has been, to a certain extent, examined and defined for its abilities.
rodent	With such research, it has been found that the dual-functioning astrocyte is the dominant cell in the rodent SVZ; this astrocyte acts as not only a neuronal stem cell, but also as a supporting cell that promotes neurogenesis through interaction with other cells.
rodent	The human SVZ is different, however, from the rodent SVZ in two distinct ways; the first is that the astrocytes of humans are not in close juxtaposition to the ependymal layer, rather separated by a layer lacking cell bodies; the second is that the human SVZ lacks chains of migrating neuroblasts seen in rodent SVZ, in turn providing for a lesser number of neuronal cells in the human than the rodent.
rodent	For this reason, while rodent SVZ proves as a valuable source of information regarding the SVZ and its structure-to-function relationship, the human model will prove significantly different.

cyclone	Science of forecasting how a tropical cyclone moves and its effects
cyclone	Tropical cyclone forecasting is the science of forecasting where a tropical cyclone's center, and its effects, are expected to be at some point in the future.
cyclone	There are several elements to tropical cyclone forecasting: track forecasting, intensity forecasting, rainfall forecasting, storm surge, tornado, and seasonal forecasting.
cyclone	The 1930s saw the usage of radiosondes in tropical cyclone forecasting.
cyclone	The launch of the first weather satellite, TIROS-I, in 1960, introduced new forecasting techniques that remain important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present.
cyclone	He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel to an increase in major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast.
cyclone	Gray issued his first seasonal forecast ahead of the 1984 season, which used the statistical relationships between tropical cyclone activity, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and Caribbean basin sea-level pressures.
cyclone	Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system.
cyclone	Forecasters say they are less skilful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones than cyclone track.
cyclone	"Dr. Kerry Emanuel created a mathematical model around 1988, called the ""maximum potential intensity"" or MPI, to compute the upper limit of tropical cyclone intensity based on sea surface temperature and atmospheric profiles from the latest global model runs."
cyclone	When formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10, the graph generated by this function corresponds to the 99th percentile of empirical tropical cyclone intensity data.
cyclone	Tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting is important, since between 1970 and 2004, inland flooding from tropical cyclones caused most of the fatalities from tropical cyclones in the United States.
cyclone	Therefore, an accurate track forecast is essential in order to produce an accurate tropical cyclone rainfall forecast.
cyclone	Historically, tropical cyclone tracking charts were used to include the past track and prepare future forecasts at Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.
cyclone	Like most of the other forecasts for tropical cyclone effects, an accurate track forecast is required in order to produce an accurate tornado threat forecast.
cyclone	The 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season was one of the least active South Pacific tropical cyclone seasons on record, with only four tropical cyclones occurring within the South Pacific basin to the east of 160°E.

cyclone	According to NIWA there was an average risk of a tropical cyclone coming within 550 km (340 mi) of Tuvalu, Fiji, Tonga, Tokelau, Wallis and Futuna, and Northern New Zealand, while the risks for the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Samoa and Niue were variable and uncertain.
cyclone	On December 7 the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 185 km/h, (115 mph ) which made Daman a Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale.
cyclone	Later that day Daman also reached its peak intensity by 1-minute means with winds of which made it a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.
cyclone	RSMC Nadi and the JTWC then reported at 0000 UTC on January 10, that 07F had developed into a tropical cyclone with RSMC Nadi naming it Elisa while located about 55 km (35 mi) to the southwest of Nukuʻalofa, Tonga.
cyclone	During that day as windshear relaxed, Elisa intensified further, before RSMC Nadi and the JTWC reported at 1800 UTC that the cyclone had reached its peak sustained windspeeds of , equivalent to a tropical storm and a category 2 tropical cyclone.
cyclone	During January 11, Elisa recurved towards the southeast into a region of cooler waters and stronger windshear, as a result the cyclone weakened into a depression, with RSMC Nadi and the JTWC issuing their final advisories later that day.
cyclone	During that day the depression moved eastwards and gradually developed further, before as vertical windshear slackened a little, the JTWC and RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had developed into a tropical cyclone with the later naming it as Funa at 0600 UTC on February 16.
cyclone	It then started to move eastwards and passed very near the next day to the northern tip of Aurora Island, Vanuatu with wind speeds of which made Funa a category two cyclone on the Australian scale.
cyclone	After leaving Vanuatu, Funa intensified slowly becoming a Category 3 severe Tropical cyclone on January 18 and then early the next day it reached its peak wind speeds of which is the same as a category 4 cyclone according to the Southern Pacific Cyclone Scale.

cyclone	The post-tropical cyclone continued westward until dissipating early on July 6.
cyclone	The cyclone moved west-northwest and then west as high pressure expanded to its north.
cyclone	The following day, however, a weakening mid-level ridge to its north directed the cyclone more poleward.
cyclone	With a mid-level ridge extending from the Gulf of Mexico into western Mexico, the newly formed cyclone moved west-northwest within an increasingly favorable environment, intensifying into Tropical Storm Elida by 06:00 UTC on July 12 and becoming the season's first hurricane around 12:00 UTC on July 14.
cyclone	Encountering strong northerly wind shear, the cyclone began a steady weakening trend shortly thereafter and ultimately degenerated to a remnant low around 12:00 UTC on July 27.
cyclone	After a brief increase in thunderstorm activity, one Tropical cyclone forecast model showed Kika reaching hurricane status.
cyclone	An area of high pressure over Mexico directed the nascent cyclone north-northwest, while moderate upper-level winds prevented Julio from strengthening beyond .
cyclone	The cyclone moved along the western periphery of an anticyclone over Mexico, and this feature imparted strong upper-level winds on Lowell that limited its peak strength to .

corrosion	A slip coupling (sometimes also called a repair coupling) is deliberately made without this internal stop to allow it to be slipped into place in tight locations, such as the repair of a pipe that has a small leak due to corrosion or freeze bursting, or which had to be cut temporarily for some reason.
corrosion	Despite its ruggedness, steel pipe is no longer preferred for conveying drinking water because corrosion can eventually cause leakage (especially at threaded joints), deposits on internal surfaces will eventually restrict flow, and corrosion will shed black or rusty residues into the flowing water.
corrosion	In older installations, the threaded brass pipe was similarly used and was considered superior to steel for drinking water because it was more resistant to corrosion and shed much fewer residues into the flowing water.

corrosion	The most common failure seen in the last 20 years is pitting corrosion in cold water tubes, also known as Type 1 pitting.
corrosion	The long life of copper when exposed to natural waters is a result of its thermodynamic stability, its high resistance to reacting with the environment, and the formation of insoluble corrosion products that insulate the metal from the environment.
corrosion	The corrosion rate of copper in most potable waters is less than 2.5 µm/year, at this rate a 15 mm tube with a wall thickness of 0.7 mm would last for about 280 years.
corrosion	In some soft waters the general corrosion rate may increase to 12.5 µm/year, but even at this rate it would take over 50 years to perforate the same tube.
corrosion	When a copper tube is initially filled with a hard water salts deposit on the wall and the copper slowly reacts with the water producing a thin protective layer of mixed corrosion products and hardness scale.
corrosion	If water is left to stand in a tube for an extended period, the chemical characteristics of the water change as the mixed scale and corrosion products are deposited.

corrosion	A volatile corrosion inhibitor (VCI) is a material that protects metals from corrosion.
corrosion	V.VCI is also called Vacuum VCI meaning they have special properties of performance in vacuum as well as corrosion protection properties.
corrosion	Corrosion inhibitors are chemical compounds that can decrease the corrosion rate of a material, typically a metal or an alloy.
corrosion	NACE International Standard TM0208 defines volatile corrosion inhibitor (VCI) as a chemical substance that acts to reduce corrosion by a combination of volatilization from a VCI material, vapor transport in the atmosphere of an enclosed environment, and condensation onto surface in the space, including absorption, dissolution, and hydrophobic effects on metal surfaces, where the rate of corrosion of metal surfaces is thereby inhibited.
corrosion	They also called vapor-phase inhibitors, vapor-phase corrosion inhibitors, and vapor-transported corrosion inhibitors.
corrosion	(3) DICHAN was used extensively by the US military to protect a wide variety of metallic components from corrosion via various delivery systems, VCI powder, VCI paper, VCI solution, VCI slushing compound, etc.
corrosion	An alkaline pH has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the corrosion resistance for steel.
corrosion	Coatings - The use of VCIs as alternative corrosion inhibitor technologies in coating is not a new concept.

corrosion	Emitter – VCI in the form of a capsule, foam, cup, etc., is placed within an electrical cabinet, junction box, etc., to provide corrosion protection to the various components inside the box.
corrosion	Pipe casings – A mixture of VCI and a swellable gel is injected into the annular space between the pipe casing (the outer pipe) and the carrier pipe (the inner pipe) as to provide corrosion protection to the carrier pipe.

corrosion	Historical data has shown that significant corrosion issues can arise as a result of residual hydrotest water (14).
corrosion	This provides corrosion mitigation until the line is put into service.
corrosion	In recent years, agricultural silos have also been constructed with porcelain enamelled steel plates to protect the interior from corrosion and the exterior from weathering; this may indicate a future trend of coating all outdoor mild steel products in a weather-resistant porcelain enamel.
corrosion	The discovery of a highly ordered crystal nanostructure of amorphous C-S-H gel and the application of photocatalyst and coating technology result in a new generation of materials with properties like water resistance, self-cleaning property, wear resistance, and corrosion protection.

corrosion	Magnesium is lighter than aluminium, however it has a greater risk of corrosion from water and may creep under load at high temperatures; this makes traditional magnesium alloys not suited for withstanding the high loads to which an engine block is exposed.
corrosion	Duralumin may have been the greatest metallurgical advance of its time and allowed aluminum to be used for structural members for the first time, normally being too soft in its pure form, while still being lighter than steel and very resistant to the types of corrosion that would compromise the strength of iron and steel alloys.
corrosion	Although there were no additional major multi-vehicle collisions after the automated de-icing system was installed, it has been raised as a possibility that the potassium acetate may have contributed to the collapse of the bridge by corroding the structural supports, though the NTSB's final report found that corrosion was not a contributing factor.
marsupial	The southern marsupial mole (Notoryctes typhlops), also known as the itjaritjari (]) or itjari-itjari, is a mole-like marsupial found in the western central deserts of Australia.
marsupial	Although the southern marsupial mole was probably known by Aboriginal Australians for thousands of years, the first specimen examined by the scientific community was collected in 1888.
marsupial	Because the marsupial mole closely resembled the golden moles of Africa, some scientists concluded that the two were related and that they had found the proof.
marsupial	This, however, is not the case, as became obvious by examining better-preserved specimens that had a marsupial pouch.
marsupial	However, recent molecular studies indicate that notoryctids are not closely related to any of the other marsupial families and should be placed in an order of their own, Notoryctemorphia.
marsupial	The increase in aridity at the end of Tertiary was likely one of the key contributing factors to the development of the current highly specialized form of marsupial mole.
marsupial	The marsupial mole had been burrowing long before the Australian deserts came into being.
marsupial	The southern marsupial mole is small in size, with a head and body length varying from 121 to 159 mm, a tail length of 21–26 mm and a weight of 40-70 g. The body is covered with short, dense, silky fur with a pale cream to white color often tinted by the iron oxides from the soil which gives it a reddish chestnut brown tint.
marsupial	"Although the brain has been regarded as very primitive and represents the ""lowliest marsupial brain"", the olfactory bulbs and the rubercula olfactoria are very well developed."
marsupial	This seems to suggest that the olfactory sense plays an important role in the marsupial moles' life, as it would be expected for a creature living in an environment lacking visual stimuli.
marsupial	"In an example of convergent evolution, the southern marsupial mole resembles the Namib Desert golden mole (""Eremitalpa granti namibensis"") and other specialised fossorial animals in having a low and unstable body temperature, ranging between 15-30 °C."
marsupial	Because it lives underground, where the temperature is considerably lower than at the surface, the southern marsupial mole does not seem to have any special adaptations to desert life.
marsupial	The habitat of the southern marsupial mole is not well known, and is generally based on scattered records.
marsupial	Due to the lack of any field studies regarding the marsupial moles, there is little known about their behavior.
marsupial	According to Aboriginal sources, marsupial moles may surface at any time of day, but seem to prefer to do so after rain and in the cooler season.
marsupial	While burrowing, the southern marsupial mole does not make permanent tunnels, but the sand caves in and tunnels back-fill as the animal moves along.
marsupial	Little is known about the southern marsupial mole's diet, and all information is based on the gut content of preserved animals and on observations made on captive specimens.
marsupial	Below the desert sands of Australia, the marsupial mole searches for burrowing insects and small reptiles.
marsupial	The southern marsupial mole was known for thousands of years to the aborigines and was part of their mythology.
marsupial	Historical records suggest that the southern marsupial mole was relatively common in the late 19th century and early 20th century.
marsupial	There was a large trade in marsupial mole skins in the Finke River region between 1900 and 1920.
marsupial	So little is known about the southern marsupial mole that it is difficult to assess its exact distribution and how it varied over the last decades.
marsupial	A recent study indicates that remains of marsupial moles have been found in 5% of the cats and foxes faecal pellets examined.
marsupial	The southern marsupial mole is currently listed as endangered by the IUCN.
marsupial	"Spencer named a small marsupial known locally as the kowari in recognition of Byrne's contribution as ""Dasyuroides byrnei"", and Byrne's work continues to contribute to scientists' understanding of central Australian mammals."
marsupial	After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs (birds being the only surviving dinosaurs) and several mammalian groups, placental and marsupial mammals diversified into many new forms and ecological niches throughout the Paleogene and Neogene, by the end of which all modern orders had appeared.
marsupial	"Although some marsupials look very like some placentals (the thylacine, ""marsupial tiger"" or ""marsupial wolf"" is a good example), marsupial skeletons have some features that distinguish them from placentals:"
marsupial	"Marsupials also have a pair of marsupial bones (sometimes called ""epipubic bones""), which support the pouch in females."
marsupial	"The sole seed-dispersal vector for both epiphytic and terrestrial populations of ""Desfontainia"" in the ""Fitzroya"" forest remnants of Chile and Argentina is the chumaihuén (""Dromiciops gliroides""), an edible dormouse-like marsupial in length (including tail)."
marsupial	This little creature, part frugivore and part insectivore forms an evolutionary link from the marsupials of South America to the marsupial fauna of Australia.
marsupial	This marsupial is found throughout the Brazilian cerrado, usually associated with mesic areas such as gallery forests.
marsupial	"""M. dimidiata"" is thought to be a miniature analog to the marsupial sabertooths ""Thylacosmilus""."
marsupial	Like extinct sabertooth predators, it has one of the largest canines of any marsupial relative to body size and was proposed as a living model to test hypotheses about hunting strategies of the extinct predators.
marsupial	"""M. kunsi"" is a marsupial from the family Didelphidae of the order Didelphimorphia."
marsupial	"""Monodelphis kunsi"" is a terrestrial marsupial that inhabits a wide range of habitats within South America."
marsupial	The marsupial frogs are a disputed family (Amphignathodontidae) in the order Anura.
marsupial	"In the 1990s he began producing ""minimalist"" paintings that depicted the imprint of a kangaroo in the sand, the seeds that the marsupial mouse feeds upon, or the aftermath of hailstorms in the desert."
marsupial	Mycorrhizal fungi attach to the roots to produce food for marsupial animals, and these animals in turn disperse the spores in their droppings to perpetuates the symbiotic relationship between wattle's roots and the mycorrhizal fungi.
marsupial	It is an Australian marsupial similar to the Ooldea dunnart, with its upper body yellow-brown and lower body white in colour.

marsupial	It breeds relatively easily in laboratory settings, and neonates are exposed and can be readily accessed because, unlike other marsupial species, female opossums lack a pouch: neonates simply cling to the teats.
marsupial	South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive marsupial fauna.
marsupial	All amphibians, birds, reptiles, some fish, and a few mammals (monotremes, tenrecs, golden moles, and marsupial moles) have this orifice, from which they excrete both urine and feces in addition to serving reproductive functions.
marsupial	In fact, modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree, and a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.
marsupial	The start of the Oligocene is marked by a notable extinction event called the Grande Coupure; it featured the replacement of European fauna with Asian fauna, except for the endemic rodent and marsupial families.

marsupial	For example, when he discovered a fossil that resembled a marsupial in the gypsum quarries of Montmartre, he correctly predicted that the fossil would contain bones commonly found in marsupials in its pelvis as well.
marsupial	To him, the predictive capabilities of his principles demonstrated in his prediction of the existence of marsupial pelvic bones in the gypsum quarries of Montmartre demonstrated that these goals were not only in reach, but imminent.

marsupial	The area was occupied by herbivores favoring shrubland, horned turtles, marsupial tapirs and diprotodontid species, but the fauna associated with this site were rarely the forest dwelling paleospecies of the period.
marsupial	The dates derived have been interpreted as suggesting that the main mechanism for extinction was human burning of a landscape that was then much less fire-adapted; oxygen and carbon isotopes of teeth indicate sudden, drastic, non-climate-related changes in vegetation and in the diet of surviving marsupial species.
marsupial	Joyner's interest has been in the nineteenth century phenomenon known as the yahoo (also called the hairy man, Australian ape or Australian gorilla), a shadowy creature then seen as an undiscovered marsupial but one that was presumably extinct by the early twentieth century.
marsupial	"It has been suggested that its specialized predatory lifestyle could be linked to more extensive parental care than in modern marsupial predators, due that the killing technique only could be used by adult individuals with a full development of its peculiar dental anatomy and grasping abilities; it could require some time for young individuals to learn the necessary skills, although there are no clear evidence in the fossils ""Thylacosmilus"", and this kind of cooperative behavior is unknown in modern marsupials."
marsupial	Antechinus (/æntɪˈkaɪnəs/ ('ant-echinus')) is a genus of small dasyurid marsupial endemic to Australia.

acid rain	These areas contain some of the last remaining stands of red spruce, which are seriously threatened by acid rain and could be further stressed by changing climate.
acid rain	In the past 20 years, the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.
acid rain	The freezing temperatures probably reversed after 3 years and returned to normal within decades, sulfuric acid aerosols causing acid rain probably dissipated after 10 years, and dust from the impact blocking out sunlight and inhibiting photosynthesis would have lasted up to a year though potential global wildfires raging for several years would have released more particulates into the atmosphere.

biodiversity	Biodiversity informatics is the application of informatics techniques to biodiversity information, such as taxonomy, biogeography or ecology.
biodiversity	Biodiversity informatics (different but linked to bioinformatics) is the application of information technology methods to the problems of organizing, accessing, visualizing and analyzing primary biodiversity data.
biodiversity	Primary biodiversity data is composed of names, observations and records of specimens, and genetic and morphological data associated to a specimen.
biodiversity	The term biodiversity informatics is also used to cover the computational problems specific to the names of biological entities, such as the development of algorithms to cope with variant representations of identifiers such as species names and authorities, and the multiple classification schemes within which these entities may reside according to the preferences of different workers in the field, as well as the syntax and semantics by which the content in taxonomic databases can be made machine queryable and interoperable for biodiversity informatics purposes...
biodiversity	Biodiversity Informatics can be considered to have commenced with the construction of the first computerized taxonomic databases in the early 1970s, and progressed through subsequent developing of distributed search tools towards the late 1990s including the Species Analyst from Kansas University, the North American Biodiversity Information Network NABIN, CONABIO in Mexico, INBio in Costa Rica, and others, the establishment of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility in 2001, and the parallel development of a variety of niche modelling and other tools to operate on digitized biodiversity data from the mid-1980s onwards (e.g.
biodiversity	"In September 2000, the U.S. journal ""Science"" devoted a special issue to ""Bioinformatics for Biodiversity"", the journal ""Biodiversity Informatics"" commenced publication in 2004, and several international conferences through the 2000s have brought together biodiversity informatics practitioners, including the London e-Biosphere conference in June 2009."
biodiversity	"A supplement to the journal ""BMC Bioinformatics"" (Volume 10 Suppl 14) published in November 2009 also deals with biodiversity informatics."
biodiversity	"According to correspondence reproduced by Walter Berendsohn, the term ""Biodiversity Informatics"" was coined by John Whiting in 1992 to cover the activities of an entity known as the Canadian Biodiversity Informatics Consortium, a group involved with fusing basic biodiversity information with environmental economics and geospatial information in the form of GPS and GIS."
biodiversity	Subsequently, it appears to have lost any obligate connection with the GPS/GIS world and be associated with the computerized management of any aspects of biodiversity information (e.g.

biodiversity	Providing online, coherent digital access to this vast collection of disparate primary data is a core Biodiversity Informatics function that is at the heart of regional and global biodiversity data networks, examples of the latter including OBIS and GBIF.
biodiversity	As a secondary source of biodiversity data, relevant scientific literature can be parsed either by humans or (potentially) by specialized information retrieval algorithms to extract the relevant primary biodiversity information that is reported therein, sometimes in aggregated / summary form but frequently as primary observations in narrative or tabular form.
biodiversity	The Biodiversity Heritage Library is also making significant progress in its aim to digitize substantial portions of the out-of-copyright taxonomic literature, which is then subjected to optical character recognition (OCR) so as to be amenable to further processing using biodiversity informatics tools.
biodiversity	Examples of relevant standards include the Darwin Core XML schema for specimen- and observation-based biodiversity data developed from 1998 onwards, plus extensions of the same, Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema, plus standards for Structured Descriptive Data, and Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD); while data retrieval and transfer protocols include DiGIR (now mostly superseded) and TAPIR (TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval).
biodiversity	A post-conference workshop of key persons with current significant Biodiversity Informatics roles also resulted in a Workshop Resolution that stressed, among other aspects, the need to create durable, global registries for the resources that are basic to biodiversity informatics (e.g., repositories, collections); complete the construction of a solid taxonomic infrastructure; and create ontologies for biodiversity data.

acidification	This leads to an acidification of the stroma that inactivates key enzymes in carbon fixation, which all leads to the production of oxygen free radicals in the chloroplast that then cause oxidative damage.
acidification	Structural changes include possible alterations in the epithelial cells, hindering processes involved in acidification of the blood and leading to a decline in the rate of gas deposition.
acidification	An increase in ocean acidification destabilizes Samoan reefs by impacting crustose corraline algae, a calcareous species that consolidates and cements reefs together.
acidification	The increase in acidification also makes it difficult for clams in all stages of life to grow their shells, and for the larvae of corral reef fish to grow, survive, and make it back to the reef.
acidification	Therefore, acidification must be halted, on loamy soils for example by raising the ground watertable slightly, or by removing the acid humus layer.
acidification	Caspase-1 activity has also been implicated in lysosome acidification following phagocytosis of bacteria and immune complexes.
acidification	Arctic Council working groups document Arctic problems and challenges such as sea ice loss, glacier melting, tundra thawing, increase of mercury in food chains, and ocean acidification affecting the entire marine ecosystem.
acidification	Ocean acidification is the decrease in the pH of the Earth’s ocean.
acidification	The effects of ocean acidification are therefore impacting marine ecosystems that provide food, livelihoods, and other ecosystem services for a large portion of humanity.
acidification	Ongoing acidification of the oceans may therefore threaten food chains linked with the oceans.
acidification	"Ocean acidification has been called the ""evil twin of global warming"" and ""the other CO2 problem""."
acidification	"Increased ocean temperatures and oxygen loss act concurrently with ocean acidification and constitute the ""deadly trio"" of climate change pressures on the marine environment."
acidification	Ocean acidification and the resulting decrease in carbonate saturation states raise the saturation horizons of both forms closer to the surface.
acidification	Ocean acidification will increase such dissolution and shallow the carbonate compensation depth on timescales of tens to hundreds of years.
acidification	Ocean acidification is progressing in the open ocean as the CO2 travels to deeper depth as a result of ocean mixing.
acidification	It is expected that ocean acidification in the future will lead to a significant decrease in the burial of carbonate sediments for several centuries, and even the dissolution of existing carbonate sediments.
acidification	Some regions exhibited a slower acidification rate: a pH decline of minus 0.010 to minus 0.013 pH unit per decade has been observed in warm pools in the western tropical Pacific.
acidification	The rate at which ocean acidification will occur may be influenced by the rate of surface ocean warming, because warm waters will not absorb as much CO2.
acidification	The difference in changes in temperature between basins is one of the main reasons for the differences in acidification rates in different localities.
acidification	Current rates of ocean acidification have been likened to the greenhouse event at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary (about 56 million years ago), when surface ocean temperatures rose by 5–6 degrees Celsius.
acidification	Extensive observational systems are now in place or being built for monitoring seawater CO2 chemistry and acidification for both the global open ocean and some coastal systems.
acidification	An important aspect to realize with ocean acidification that is happening today is that the rate of change is much higher than the geologic past.
acidification	Current ocean acidification is now on a path to reach lower pH levels than at any other point in the last 300 million years.
acidification	Ocean acidification has also been suggested as a one cause of the end-Permian mass extinction and the end-Cretaceous crisis.
acidification	The most notable example of ocean acidification is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which occurred approximately 56 million years ago when massive amounts of carbon entered the ocean and atmosphere, and led to the dissolution of carbonate sediments across many ocean basins.
acidification	The full ecological consequences of the changes in calcification due to ocean acidification are complex but it appears likely that many calcifying species will be adversely affected by ocean acidification.
acidification	Increasing ocean acidification makes it more difficult for shell-accreting organisms to access carbonate ions, essential for the production of their hard exoskeletal shell.
acidification	Overall, all marine ecosystems on Earth will be exposed to changes in acidification and several other ocean biogeochemical changes.
acidification	Ocean acidification may force some organisms to reallocate resources away from productive endpoints in order to maintain calcification.
acidification	Seawater acidification could also reduce the size of Antarctic phytoplankton, making them less effective at storing carbon.
acidification	Pteropods shells dissolve with increasing acidification and the brittle stars lose muscle mass when re-growing appendages.
acidification	Pteropods are severely affected because increasing acidification levels have steadily decreased the amount of water supersaturated with carbonate.
acidification	For example, the elevated oceanic levels of CO2 may produce CO2-induced acidification of body fluids, known as hypercapnia.
acidification	This is possibly because ocean acidification may alter the acoustic properties of seawater, allowing sound to propagate further, and increasing ocean noise.
acidification	However, a meta-analysis published in 2022 found that the effect sizes of published studies testing for ocean acidification effects on fish behavior have declined by an order of magnitude over the past decade and have been negligible for the past five years.
acidification	Here is where European eels are experiencing the effects of acidification in one of their key life stages.
acidification	A study of the European Eel in the Sargasso Sea was conducted in 2021 to analyze the specific effects ocean acidification had on embryos.
acidification	The study found that exposure to predicted end-of-century ocean pCO2 conditions may affect normal development of this species in nature during sensitive early life history stages with limited physiological response capacities, while extreme acidification will negatively influence embryonic survival and development under hatchery conditions.
acidification	There is a substantial body of research showing that a combination of ocean acidification and elevated ocean temperature have a compounded effect on marine life and the ocean environment.
acidification	The threat of acidification includes a decline in commercial fisheries and the coast-based tourism industry.
acidification	Several ocean goods and services are likely to be undermined by future ocean acidification potentially affecting the livelihoods of some 400 to 800 million people, depending upon the greenhouse gas emission scenario.
acidification	Ongoing acidification of the oceans may therefore threaten future food chains linked with the oceans.
acidification	In the Arctic, commercial fisheries are threatened because acidification harms calcifying organisms which form the base of the Arctic food webs (pteropods and brittle stars, see above).
acidification	Baby red king crab when exposed to increased acidification levels experienced 100% mortality after 95 days.
acidification	"This is why the term ""local ocean acidification mitigation"" is used."
acidification	As awareness about ocean acidification grows, policies geared towards increasing monitoring efforts of ocean acidification have been drafted.

eutrophication	While improvements have been made, there are still issues with eutrophication (an increase in nitrogen and phosphates) in many lakes in the Swiss Plateau.
eutrophication	The causes of these environmental issues are toxic contamination, eutrophication (low oxygen due to excess nutrients), and near shore habitat changes.
eutrophication	Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the O2 content in eutrophic water bodies.
eutrophication	An excess of phosphorus can also be problematic, especially in aquatic systems where eutrophication sometimes leads to algal blooms.
eutrophication	Harmful environmental issues such as ozone depletion, ocean acidification, eutrophication and climate change came to the public's attention and caused the onset of environmental studies.

eutrophication	Excess levels of phosphorus come from multiple sources, but namely the wastewater treatment plants, are extremely concerning when it comes to Utah Lake management because high levels can trigger harmful algal blooms and eutrophication There is some discussion as to how much of the phosphorus is the result of anthropogenic causes and how much is the result of historic phosphorus stored in the lake sediment.
eutrophication	For example, the average harvested mussel contains: 0.8–1.2% nitrogen and 0.06–0.08% phosphorus Removal of enhanced biomass can not only combat eutrophication and also support the local economy by providing product for animal feed or compost.
eutrophication	In the 1990s the lake suffered from blooms of blue-green algae which indicated a significant and worrying eutrophication of the lake.
eutrophication	Such widespread environmental impacts include nitrogen fertilizer losses into waterways, which can lead to eutrophication (nutrient loading) and ensuing hypoxia (oxygen depletion) of large bodies of water.
eutrophication	Changes in climates and global warming not only influence the timing in migration, but also plant diversity in key habitual areas for birds due to processes like eutrophication which result in higher levels of nitrogen present in water.
eutrophication	The runoff caused large amounts of phosphorus to enter the river, eventually leading to cultural eutrophication in Lake Erie.

eutrophication	Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth.
eutrophication	There are also many indirect impacts derived from the production of biofuels, for example in Europe a study was conducted on the production of biodiesel from rapeseed oil, showing that using B100 instead of petrol diesel increased acidification by 59% and eutrophication by 214% due to the added nutrients and run-off.
eutrophication	"The eutrophication of the ""Lagoa das Sete Cidades"" lakes, due to nutrient enrichment was enhanced by human agricultural and domestic activities, began to be noticed in 1987 and led to the implementation of a monitoring program."
eutrophication	As the existence of a eutrophication process in Sete Cidades lake was already known since the 1980s, the rise of cyanobacteria blooms was not unexpected by 2000.

eutrophication	After a 1989 study determined that the plant was causing eutrophication of the lake, the outflow was diverted into a sewer line in 1992.
eutrophication	In other instances, eutrophication can lead to an outright replacement of habitat dominants, such as when macroalgae replaces corals on reefs, leading to a change or loss in components of a facilitation cascade and there a shift in the broader community.
eutrophication	The deterioration of coastal waters has become a global occurrence, due to pollution and coastal eutrophication (overflow of nutrients in water), where similar contributing factors to climate change can affect oceans and negatively impact marine biodiversity.

eutrophication	"Globally, ""Potamogeton pusillus"" is listed as Least Concern.There is no evidence of local declines and in many areas it is probably increasing due to eutrophication of freshwater habitats."
eutrophication	However, they may also have harmful impacts such as the excessive growth of non-native plants or eutrophication of the lakes in which they live leading to anoxic conditions.
eutrophication	The lake is under eutrophication stress which means that nutrients are not a limiting factor for either of the plant agents in the model.
eutrophication	The increasing eutrophication could be stemmed by sewage works, but also due to a declining number of guests, which has reached the climax around 1980.
eutrophication	High amounts of anthropogenic nitrogen discharge could cause eutrophication in previously N-limited environments, leading to hypoxic conditions in the seagrass meadow and affecting the carrying capacity of that ecosystem.
eutrophication	Hypoxia that leads to eutrophication caused from ocean deoxygenation is one of the main underlying factors of these die-offs.
eutrophication	Unfortunately, the wetland habitats used for nesting by this species are under threat by problems such as eutrophication due to agriculture runoff, which causes a loss in aquatic plants, making it difficult for the ducks to find food reliably much less build nests out of said aquatic/herbaceous plants along with grazing cattle trampling down nests and vegetation needed to hide the nests to begin with.
eutrophication	The Lake also used to be a source of water supply to the city of Mysore but over the years, sewage and excessive land encroachments (mostly illegal) and blockage of water flow sources almost led to the eutrophication of the lake.

eutrophication	Because of its location in an important agricultural zone in the South of Uruguay, nutrient runoff and eutrophication is common due to intensive agriculture.
eutrophication	Thus phosphorus is the main culprit in eutrophication of surface water; however, the other limiting nutrient, nitrogen, causes substantial damage to waters.
eutrophication	Algal blooms caused by eutrophication also lead to hypoxic conditions, which seagrasses are also highly susceptible to.
eutrophication	The high nutrient content can lead to eutrophication (hypertrophication), the growth of bacterial or algal blooms.
eutrophication	Hypoxia and eutrophication (low oxygen level resulting conditions) are direct environmental impacts on the Sound that are exacerbated by higher temperatures, stratified water columns (when the water is not well mixed vertically) and excess nutrients.

eutrophication	"Some of the architects thought that there was a high dependency and credit given to energy and green building rating systems such as the ""Green Star Environment Rating System"" but not enough credit was given to the improvements carried out during adaptive reuse and its sustainable outcomes such as the recycling of building materials, reduced energy and water consumption and reduced environmental impacts like global warming potential, lake eutrophication potential and ozone layer depletion."
eutrophication	The underlying mechanism through which eutrophication can increase infection involves increasing the density of infected first-intermediate snail hosts and by increasing the production of parasites by infected snails (Johnson et al.
eutrophication	The cause of these environmental issues are, toxic contamination, eutrophication (low oxygen due to excess nutrients), and near shore habitat changes.
eutrophication	Because only a fraction of the nitrogen in fertilizers is efficiently used to help produce crops, this has led to a greater concentration of nitrates and phosphates in the waters, causing eutrophication and contamination of possible drinking water.
eutrophication	These increase salinity and total dissolved solids, and phosphorus compounds may provide the limiting essential nutrient for algal growth contributing to biofouling of the cooling system or to eutrophication of natural aquatic environments receiving blowdown or OTC water.
eutrophication	Mature compost of plant-based origins, used in animal-free agriculture, can reduce leaching of nitrate which leads to an improvement in groundwater quality and counteracts the eutrophication of surface waters.
eutrophication	"The distributions of ""M. elegantula"" and ""M. exasperatula"" seem to be affected by anthropogenic factors, including eutrophication and air pollution."
eutrophication	Much of the river catchment is used for cattle (grazing); excess nutrients cause some eutrophication in some pools upstream.
eutrophication	Increased levels of nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems can cause eutrophication which is the process of excessive introduction of nutrients causing an abundance of plant growth which can result in the death of a variety of aquatic life.

greenhouse effect	However, water and ice absorb in infrared and close the infrared atmospheric window thereby contributing to the greenhouse effect ...
greenhouse effect	This resurgence of the coal forests in very late Carboniferous times seems to have coincided with a lowering of global temperatures and a return of extensive polar ice in southern Gondwana, perhaps due to lessening of the greenhouse effect as the massive coal deposition process extracted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
greenhouse effect	"Over 4 to 30 million years, enough CO2 and methane, mainly emitted by volcanoes but also produced by microbes converting organic carbon trapped under the ice into the gas, would accumulate to finally cause enough greenhouse effect to make surface ice melt in the tropics until a band of permanently ice-free land and water developed; this would be darker than the ice, and thus absorb more energy from the Sun—initiating a ""positive feedback""."
greenhouse effect	"A ""nuclear summer"" is a hypothesized scenario in which, after a nuclear winter caused by aerosols inserted into the atmosphere that would prevent sunlight from reaching lower levels or the surface, has abated, a greenhouse effect then occurs due to carbon dioxide released by combustion and methane released from the decay of the organic matter and methane from dead organic matter and corpses that froze during the nuclear winter."
greenhouse effect	"As this process removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect would be reduced until surface temperatures dropped to ""comfortable"" levels."
greenhouse effect	Paleoclimatology, although sometimes treated as part of paleoecology, focuses more on the history of Earth's climate and the mechanisms that have changed it – which have sometimes included evolutionary developments, for example the rapid expansion of land plants in the Devonian period removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the greenhouse effect and thus helping to cause an ice age in the Carboniferous period.
greenhouse effect	In a 2020 paper, scientists reconstructed the mechanisms that led to the extinction event in a biogeochemical model, showed the consequences of the greenhouse effect on the marine environment, and concluded that the mass extinction can be traced back to volcanic CO2 emissions.
greenhouse effect	In that scenario, warming from the enhanced greenhouse effect would reduce the solubility of oxygen in seawater, causing the concentration of oxygen to decline.
greenhouse effect	A runaway greenhouse effect occurs when a planet's atmosphere contains greenhouse gas in an amount sufficient to block thermal radiation from leaving the planet, preventing the planet from cooling and from having liquid water on its surface.
greenhouse effect	A runaway version of the greenhouse effect can be defined by a limit on a planet's outgoing longwave radiation which is asymptotically reached due to higher surface temperatures evaporating a condensable species (often water vapor) into the atmosphere, increasing its optical depth.
greenhouse effect	The runaway greenhouse effect is often formulated with water vapor as the condensable species.
greenhouse effect	The physics relevant to the, later-termed, runaway greenhouse effect was explored by Makoto Komabayashi at Nagoya university.
greenhouse effect	The runaway greenhouse effect is often formulated in terms of how the surface temperature of a planet changes with differing amounts of received starlight.
greenhouse effect	Though water plays a major role in the process, the runaway greenhouse effect is not a result of water vapor feedback.
greenhouse effect	"The runaway greenhouse effect can be seen as a limit on a planet's outgoing longwave radiation that, when surpassed, results in a state where water cannot exist in its liquid form (hence, the oceans have all ""boiled away"")."
greenhouse effect	At these values the runaway greenhouse effect overcomes the Stefan–Boltzmann feedback so an increase in a planet's surface temperature will not increase the outgoing longwave radiation.
greenhouse effect	A runaway greenhouse effect involving carbon dioxide and water vapor may have occurred on Venus.
greenhouse effect	If Venus initially formed with water, the runaway greenhouse effect would have hydrated Venus' stratosphere, and the water would have escaped to space.
greenhouse effect	The deficit of water on Venus due to the runaway greenhouse effect is thought to explain why Venus does not exhibit surface features consistent with plate tectonics, meaning it would be a stagnant lid planet.
greenhouse effect	As with the uncertainties in calculating the inner edge of the habitable zone, the uncertainty in whether CO2 can drive a moist greenhouse effect is due to differences in modeling choices and the uncertainties therein.
greenhouse effect	Most scientists believe that a runaway greenhouse effect is inevitable in the long term, as the Sun gradually becomes more luminous as it ages, and spell the end of all life on Earth.
greenhouse effect	""""" was recorded in 1987 and set 25 years in a future where environmental abuse and the burning of fossil fuels have created a greenhouse effect leading to an end of the world scenario."
greenhouse effect	Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect in this case is the ability of a reflective surface to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation.
greenhouse effect	If the asteroid hit an ocean (which would be the case with the majority of impact events), water vapor would form the majority of any ejected matter, and would likely result in a major greenhouse effect and a net increase in temperature.
greenhouse effect	The dominant contributor to the greenhouse effect is water vapour (~50%), with clouds (~25%) and CO2 (~20%) also playing an important role.
greenhouse effect	By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth, though if high levels of carbon dioxide are present in the planetary atmosphere, the greenhouse effect could keep temperatures above freezing.
greenhouse effect	The mean blackbody surface temperature has been estimated to lie between −3 °C (for a Venus-like albedo) and 40 °C (for an Earth-like albedo), however, the temperatures could be much higher (about 500 degrees Celsius) due to a runaway greenhouse effect akin to that of Venus.

greenhouse effect	As a result of a runaway greenhouse effect Venus has a temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius), hot enough to melt lead.
greenhouse effect	With most carbon dioxide staying in the atmosphere for good, the greenhouse effect worsened even more.
greenhouse effect	The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases that absorb sunlight.
greenhouse effect	Thus, terrestrial planets in the actual habitable zones, if provided with abundant surface water in their formation, would have been subject to a runaway greenhouse effect for several hundred million years.
greenhouse effect	However, the total CIA contribution of Earth's major gases, N2 and O2, to the atmosphere's natural greenhouse effect is relatively minor except near the poles.
greenhouse effect	"This process is only possible if the greenhouse effect is removed with the use of ""high-altitude absorbing fine particles"" or a sun shield, creating a more habitable Venus."
greenhouse effect	The experiment, however, was careless seen from the current perspective with erroneous result but of a historical significance in the development of the theory of the greenhouse effect amplified by CO2.
greenhouse effect	The result is a much larger greenhouse effect than that due to CO2 alone.
greenhouse effect	Thus, the strength of the greenhouse effect depends on the atmosphere's rate of temperature decrease with height.
greenhouse effect	The weaker greenhouse effect in the Martian atmosphere (, versus on Earth) can be explained by the low abundance of other greenhouse gases.
greenhouse effect	To explain the coexistence of liquid water and faint young Sun during early Mars' history, a much stronger greenhouse effect must have occurred in the Martian atmosphere to warm the surface up above freezing point of water.
greenhouse effect	Despite the high concentration of CO2 in the Martian atmosphere, the greenhouse effect is relatively weak on Mars (about 5 °C) because of the low concentration of water vapor and low atmospheric pressure.
greenhouse effect	While water vapor in Earth's atmosphere has the largest contribution to greenhouse effect on modern Earth, it is present in only very low concentration in the Martian atmosphere.
greenhouse effect	He also did not understand the greenhouse effect caused by Venus' atmosphere, which had earlier been elucidated by astronomer Rupert Wildt.
greenhouse effect	It is intended to form the basis of an international agreement which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions to avoid dangerous climate change, carbon dioxide being the gas that is primarily responsible for changes in the greenhouse effect on Earth.
greenhouse effect	Working Group I subsequently characterized its reports in the First and Second Assessments as progressing from an understanding that the greenhouse effect is well understood, greenhouse gases are increasing (due largely to human activity), and therefore should lead to significant global warming (though lack of understanding limited specific regional predictions), to a greater understanding (despite continuing uncertainties) that global warming continues and is most likely due to human activity, and that very substantial cuts in emissions would be required to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations.

greenhouse effect	Since 2000 the nuclear industry has undertaken an international media and lobbying campaign to promote nuclear power as a solution to the greenhouse effect and climate change.
greenhouse effect	There appears to be a strong scientific consensus that industrialized civilization has emitted enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to create a greenhouse effect causing global warming, yet debate rages primarily over the economic effects of limiting development.
greenhouse effect	Either carbon dioxide levels were much higher at the time, providing enough of a greenhouse effect to warm the Earth, or other greenhouse gases were present.
greenhouse effect	"During the current boom in the Permian oil fields, drilling for oil has ""far outpaced pipeline construction"" so the use of flaring has increased along with venting ""natural gas and other potent greenhouse gases directly into the atmosphere"", causing considerably larger greenhouse effect than flaring."

greenhouse effect	A shade was there to help prevent the greenhouse effect of the closed roof.
greenhouse effect	"In 2006, he testified to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (Subcommittee on Global Climate Change and Impacts) that “… we have at least two firm scientific indicators that show it is incorrect to conclude that this warming in the continental Arctic is due entirely to the greenhouse effect caused by man.” He instead ascribes warming to natural variation and has stated that ""… climate change, or temperature, has been rising."
greenhouse effect	EDS argued that the predicted annual emissions of 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide would contribute to climate change via the greenhouse effect and that the consent conditions should require complete carbon offsetting by planting of new forests.

greenhouse effect	"Hitchens has claimed that ""the greenhouse effect probably doesn't exist"" and that the scientific consensus linking global warming to human activity has not been proven, describing it as ""modish dogma""."
greenhouse effect	The proposal draws upon the hypothesized Azolla event that asserts that Azolla once covered the Arctic and then sank, permanently sequestering teratons of carbon that would otherwise have contributed to the planet's greenhouse effect and ending a warming event that reached degrees warmer than twenty-first century averages.
greenhouse effect	"A study of Arctic paleoclimatology reported that ""Azolla"" may have had a significant role in reversing an increase in greenhouse effect that occurred 55 million years ago that had caused the region around the north pole to turn into a hot, tropical environment."
greenhouse effect	"It indicates that massive patches of ""Azolla"" growing on the (then) freshwater surface of the Arctic Ocean consumed enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for the global greenhouse effect to decline, eventually causing the formation of ice sheets in Antarctica and the current ""icehouse period""."
greenhouse effect	"Large increases since the late 1960s in rainfall over the Northern Territory and pastoral areas of South and Western Australia that have ""not"" been duplicated over Queensland do suggest an enhanced greenhouse effect in the Medieval Warm Period may have caused the Georgina to regularly fill Lake Eyre."
greenhouse effect	"In a different chapter of the book, about Eunice Newton Foote, Reed wrote that Foote's experiments confirmed that when subjected to sunlight, carbon dioxide became warmer than air ""thereby demonstrating what we call the greenhouse effect today""."
greenhouse effect	"In the case that Gliese 832 c possesses a Venusian-like atmosphere, which it could have due to its eccentric orbit (and the stellar flux reaching 1.45 ""S""🜨, high enough to boil any oceans on its surface), the planet would be inhospitable because of a runaway greenhouse effect on its surface."
greenhouse effect	For instance, hydraulic fracturing entitles a transitional fuel for its supporters whereas for its opponents it represents a fossil fuel exacerbating the greenhouse effect and global warming.

greenhouse effect	About a quarter of the emitted carbon will stay in the atmosphere practically forever, contributing to the greenhouse effect that causes global warming.
greenhouse effect	The book differs from the scientific consensus in contending that the Great Barrier Reef will benefit from rising seas, that there is no correlation between carbon dioxide levels and temperature, and that 98% of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapour.
greenhouse effect	His first major findings were in the mid-1970s and were related to the greenhouse effect of CFCs and other trace gases Until that time, carbon dioxide was thought to be the sole greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.
greenhouse effect	ERBE was also able to measure the greenhouse effect without the use of climate models.
greenhouse effect	Maintaining such ecosystems could be globally significant in reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from standing biomass and decomposing organic matter, thus reducing the feedback mechanism that enhances the greenhouse effect and accelerates global warming.
greenhouse effect	Kalmanovitch argued that the greenhouse effect from greenhouse gas emissions has never existed to any measurable extent.
greenhouse effect	The planet would likely be inhospitable because of a runaway greenhouse effect on its surface.
