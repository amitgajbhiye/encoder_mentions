antisense	In this system, a trans-acting factor, FinO, and antisense RNAs, FinP, combine to repress the expression of the activator gene TraJ.
antisense	In genetics, a sense strand, or coding strand, is the segment within double-stranded DNA that carries the translatable code in the 5′ to 3′ direction, and which is complementary to the antisense strand of DNA, or template strand, which does not carry the translatable code in the 5′ to 3′ direction.
antisense	The sense strand is the strand of DNA that has the same sequence as the mRNA, which takes the antisense strand as its template during transcription, and eventually undergoes (typically, not always) translation into a protein.
antisense	The antisense strand is thus responsible for the RNA that is later translated to protein, while the sense strand possesses a nearly identical makeup to that of the mRNA.
antisense	Note that for each segment of double-stranded DNA, there will possibly be two sets of sense and antisense, depending on which direction one reads (since sense and antisense is relative to perspective).
antisense	But keep in mind that sometimes, such as in prokaryotes, overlapping genes on opposite strands means the sense for one mRNA can be the antisense for another mRNA.
antisense	Knowing the difference between the sense and antisense strands is important in certain molecular biology applications.
antisense	It is actually the antisense strand that is used as the template from which RNA polymerases construct the RNA transcript, but the complementary base-pairing by which nucleic acid polymerization occurs means that the sequence of the RNA transcript will look identical to the positive-sense strand, apart from the RNA transcript's use of uracil instead of thymine.
antisense	In other words, either DNA strand can serve as the sense or antisense strand.
antisense	However, the DNA sense strand itself is not used as the template for the mRNA; it is the DNA antisense strand that serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA sense strand, it is used as a template for the mRNA.
antisense	Since transcription results in an RNA product complementary to the DNA template strand, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA antisense strand.
antisense	Hence, a base triplet 3′-TAC-5′ in the DNA antisense strand (complementary to the 5′-ATG-3′ of the DNA sense strand) is used as the template which results in a 5′-AUG-3′ base triplet in the mRNA.
antisense	"""DNA strand 1: antisense strand"" (transcribed to) → ""RNA strand (sense)"""
antisense	The transcribed DNA strand is called the template strand, with antisense sequence, and the mRNA transcript produced from it is said to be sense sequence (the complement of antisense).
antisense	Both Watson and Crick strands can be either sense or antisense strands depending on the specific gene product made from them.
antisense	"Whether the strand is sense (positive) or antisense (negative), the default query sequence in NCBI BLAST alignment is ""Plus"" strand."
antisense	When mRNA forms a duplex with a complementary antisense RNA sequence, translation is blocked.
antisense	Cells can produce antisense RNA molecules naturally, called microRNAs, which interact with complementary mRNA molecules and inhibit their expression.

antisense	Several viruses, such as influenza viruses Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), have been targeted using antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit their replication in host cells.
antisense	If the antisense oligonucleotide contains a stretch of DNA or a DNA mimic (phosphorothioate DNA, 2′F-ANA, or others) it can recruit RNase H to degrade the target RNA.
antisense	Double-stranded RNA can also act as a catalytic, enzyme-dependent antisense agent through the RNAi/siRNA pathway, involving target mRNA recognition through sense-antisense strand pairing followed by target mRNA degradation by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
antisense	The R1 plasmid hok/sok system provides yet another example of an enzyme-dependent antisense regulation process through enzymatic degradation of the resulting RNA duplex.

antisense	developed different 20-mer phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides that target different regions in the mRNA of the survivin gene.
antisense	The antisense function of the oligonucleotides allows binding to surviving mRNA and, depending on the region on which it binds, might inhibit surviving mRNA from being translated into a functional protein.
antisense	The best antisense oligonucleotide was identified that effectively down-regulated survivin mRNA levels and resulted in apoptosis of the cells.
antisense	To further see whether survivin played a key role in sensitization of the cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs, survivin antisense oligonucleotides were used to knock down any survivin mRNA, and, thus, its possibility to be translated is also eliminated.

contig	Sets of overlapping clones that form a contiguous stretch of DNA are called contigs; the minimum number of clones that form a contig that covers the entire chromosome comprise the tiling path that is used for sequencing.
contig	Since these clones should cover the entire genome/chromosome, it is theoretically possible to assemble a contig of BACs that covers the entire chromosome.
contig	If gaps between contigs remain after STS landmark mapping and restriction fingerprinting have been performed, the sequencing of contig ends can be used to close these gaps.
contig	Alternatively, the end sequence of a contig can be used as a primer to primer walk across the gap.
contig	The physical maps were integrated together with genetic maps to identify contig positions and orientations.
contig	Data were assembled using PacBio’s hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP), and showed that long-read assemblies revealed a 63-fold improvement in contig size over an Illumina-only assembly.
contig	Researchers found that Linepithema humile virus-1 (LHUV-1) was detected in sample sites from the n1000 contig sequence in Argentina, Australia, and less than half of the sites tested from New Zealand.

crossbite	In other words, crossbite is a lateral misalignment of the dental arches.
crossbite	An anterior crossbite can be referred as negative overjet, and is typical of class III skeletal relations (prognathism).
crossbite	An anterior crossbite in a child with baby teeth or mixed dentition may happen due to either dental misalignment or skeletal misalignment.
crossbite	An anterior crossbite due to dental component involves displacement of either maxillary central or lateral incisors lingual to their original erupting positions.
crossbite	This will lead to anterior crossbite where upon biting, upper teeth are behind the lower front teeth and may involve few or all frontal incisors.
crossbite	Another reason that may lead to a dental crossbite is crowding in the maxillary arch.
crossbite	Side-effects caused by dental crossbite can be increased recession on the buccal of lower incisors and higher chance of inflammation in the same area.
crossbite	"Another term for an anterior crossbite due to dental interferences is ""Pseudo Class III Crossbite or Malocclusion""."
crossbite	An anterior crossbite due to skeletal reasons will involve a deficient maxilla and a more hyperplastic or overgrown mandible.
crossbite	People with this type of crossbite will have dental compensation which involves proclined maxillary incisors and retroclined mandibular incisors.
crossbite	Bjork defined posterior crossbite as a malocclusion where the buccal cusps of canine, premolar and molar of upper teeth occlude lingually to the buccal cusps of canine, premolar and molar of lower teeth.
crossbite	Posterior crossbite is often correlated to a narrow maxilla and upper dental arch.
crossbite	A posterior crossbite can be unilateral, bilateral, single-tooth or entire segment crossbite.
crossbite	Posterior crossbite has been reported to occur between 7–23% of the population.
crossbite	The most common type of posterior crossbite to occur is the unilateral crossbite which occurs in 80% to 97% of the posterior crossbite cases.
crossbite	"This type of crossbite usually presents with a ""functional shift of the mandible towards the side of the crossbite""."
crossbite	Posterior crossbite can occur due to either skeletal, dental or functional abnormalities.
crossbite	One of the common reasons for development of posterior crossbite is the size difference between maxilla and mandible, where maxilla is smaller than mandible.
crossbite	The most common cause of unilateral crossbite is a narrow maxillary dental arch.
crossbite	A child with posterior crossbite should be treated immediately if the child shifts their mandible on closing, which is often seen in a unilateral crossbite as mentioned above.
crossbite	The best age to treat a child with crossbite is in their mixed dentition when their palatal sutures have not fused to each other.
crossbite	One of the keys in diagnosing the anterior crossbite due to skeletal vs dental causes is diagnosing a CR-CO shift in a patient.
crossbite	An adolescent presenting with anterior crossbite may be positioning their mandible forward into centric occlusion (CO) due to the dental interferences.
crossbite	If the CR shows a less severe class 3 malocclusion or teeth not in anterior crossbite, this may mean that their anterior crossbite results due to dental interferences.
crossbite	An expansion appliance is placed in the maxilla 6–9 months prior to correct any crossbite or upper arch constriction.
crossbite	In the index there are eleven weighed and defined measurements which are: upper anterior segment overjet, lower anterior segment overjet, overbite of upper anterior over lower anterior, anterior open bite, congenital absence of incisors, distal molar relation, mesial molar relation, posterior crossbite (buccal), posterior crossbite (lingual), tooth displacement, gross anomalies.
crossbite	This term describes a lateral bite in the lower jaw and is often associated with a unilateral crossbite at an early age This can lead to bone development of an asymmetrical mandibular ramus resulting in asymmetry in the whole of the lower face.
crossbite	A posterior crossbite in these children along with decrease in intercanine and intermolar width is also found.
crossbite	Extracting the primary canines only – it produces rapid self-improvement in incisor crowding and alignment intercepting the development of lingual crossbite of the lateral incisors.
crossbite	Rapid palatal expansion (RPE) or Rapid Maxillary Expansion (RME) is an expansion technique where expansion of 0.5 mm to 1 mm is achieved each day until the posterior crossbite is relieved.
crossbite	The concept of lingualized occlusion was again influenced by Gysi, when he designed a crossbite posterior teeth model concept.
crossbite	He observed that more than half of edentulous patients at the University of Zurich had a posterior crossbite following normal physiological residual ridge resorption.
crossbite	One patient featured in the story said her orthodontist diagnosed her with a crossbite “possibly caused by” the company's aligners.

abutment	Along Interstate 580 and Greenville Road, a concrete pavement sunk , and the a concrete abutment fractured and spalled.
abutment	The design of the abutment caissons was undertaken to minimize scour downstream of the dam, arising from vortices generated by the large vertical head above the sill of the structure.
abutment	The solution adopted was the use of specially adapted caisson units for the abutment ends, with a sloping bottom to fill the triangular void between the first caisson and the slope underneath, ensuring a good fit.
abutment	Skewed caissons were specifically designed to eliminate the need for vertical abutment construction.

abutment	The Water Gardens, although listed by English Heritage, have been spoilt by the abutment of a car park and shopping centre.
abutment	Later analysis found that a Tallboy had landed on the bank at the south end of the bridge about from the abutment and the shock of the explosion shifted it, making the span fall into the river.
abutment	Retainer: The component attached to the abutment for retention of the prosthesis.
abutment	The total number of units in a bridge is equal to the number of pontics plus the number of abutment teeth.
abutment	Conventional bridges are bridges that are supported by full coverage crowns, three-quarter crowns, post-retained crowns, onlays and inlays on the abutment teeth.
abutment	In these types of bridges, the abutment teeth require preparation and reduction to support the prosthesis.
abutment	This type of design has a rigid connector at each end which connects the abutment to the pontic.
abutment	As the abutments are connected together rigidly it is critical that during tooth preparation the proximal surfaces of the abutment teeth must be prepared so that they are parallel to each other.
abutment	The abutment tooth may be mesial or distal to the pontic.
abutment	A major advantage of this type of bridge is that the movable joint can accommodate the angulation differences in the abutment teeth in long axis, which enables the path of insertion to be irrespective of the alignment of the abutment tooth.
abutment	The movable connector attaches the pontic to the mesial abutment, enabling this abutment tooth limited movement in a vertical direction.
abutment	"An adhesive bridge utilises ""wings"" on the sides of the pontic which attach it to the abutment teeth."
abutment	They are most often used when the abutment teeth are whole and sound (i.e., no crowns or major fillings).
abutment	The survival rate of bridgework can be affected by the span of bridge needed, the proposed position of the bridge, and the size, shape, number and condition of planned abutment teeth.
abutment	These include the size of potential abutment tooth, with larger teeth having an increased surface area preferable for retention, using teeth with a stable periodontal status, favourable tooth angulation, favourable tooth position, and an adequate crown-root ratio.
abutment	For resin bonded bridges abutment teeth should ideally be unrestored and have enough enamel to support the metal wing retainer.
abutment	It is acceptable for the abutment to be minimally restored with small composite restorations provided they are sound.
abutment	Ante's law, states that the roots of abutment teeth must have a combined periodontal surface area in three dimensions that is more than that of the missing root structures of the teeth replaced with a bridge, is used in bridgework design.
abutment	Cantilever designs utilising one abutment is the design of choice for replacing a single tooth anteriorly and can also be used posteriorly.
abutment	The only way to determine this is to section the bridge and try in each abutment by itself.
abutment	If they each fit individually, the spatial relationship was incorrect, and the abutment that was sectioned from the pontic must now be reattached to the pontic according to the newly confirmed spatial relationship.
abutment	With the two bridge abutments individually seated on their prepared abutment teeth, the resin is applied to the location of the sectioning to reestablish a proper spatial relationship between the two pieces.
abutment	The abutment of this bridge can still be seen adjacent to Cromwell's Castle on the Connacht side of the river.
abutment	The best known light advert was on a tower on the northern abutment of the Elbe bridge at Vockerode on the transit route from Berlin to Hof (nowadays part of the BAB 9 motorway).

abutment	The highway begins at the south abutment of the Rio Hondo bridge, and travels north to an intersection with concurrent U.S.
abutment	CERL tested a 250,000-pound Geosynthetics Reinforced Soil (GRS) bridge abutment model for the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee (UWM), with Federal Highway Administration funding.
virophage	The same team that discovered the mimivirus later discovered a slightly larger virus, dubbed the mamavirus, and the Sputnik virophage that infects it.
virophage	"Naturally however, the Sputnik virophage has been found to multiply inside species of the opportunistically pathogenic protozoan ""Acanthamoeba"", but only if that amoeba is infected with the large mamavirus."
virophage	These genes could have been acquired by Sputnik after the association of APMV with the host and then interaction between the virophage and the viral host.
virophage	Therefore, it is hypothesized that the virophage could be a source of vehicle mediating lateral gene transfer between giant viruses, which constitute a significant part of the DNA virus population in marine environments.
virophage	Moreover, the presence of three APMV genes in Sputnik implies that gene transfer between a virophage and a giant virus is crucial to viral evolution.
virophage	The Sputnik virophage has a capsid 74 nm in diameter, with icosahedral symmetry.
virophage	"In March 2011, two additional virophages were described: the Mavirus virophage which preys on the giant ""Cafeteria roenbergensis"" virus, and the Organic Lake virophage (OLV), found in the salty Organic Lake in Antarctica, and which preys on phycodnaviruses that attack algae."
virophage	Zamilon virophage was the first one found infecting a member of Mimiviridae group C (i. e. Mont1 virus), being able to grow also in Mimiviridae group B, but not group A.
virophage	Within the genome of Lentille virus integrated genome of a virophage (Sputnik 2) and a transpoviron—a mobile genetic element—have been reported.
virophage	Transpovirons are linear DNA elements of about 7 kilobases that encompass six to eight protein coding genes, two of which are homologous to virophage genes.
virophage	Broad spectrum of mimiviridae virophage allows its isolation using a mimivirus reporter.
virophage	The virophage may improve the recovery and survival of the host organism.
virophage	The first virophage was discovered in a cooling tower in Paris in 2008.
virophage	The virophage was named Sputnik and its replication relied entirely on the co-infection of ACMV and its cytoplasmic replication machinery.
virophage	Known virophages in culture have icosahedral capsid particles that measure around 40 to 80 nanometers long, and virophage particles are so small that electron microscopy must be used to view them.
virophage	Metagenomic sequence-based analyses have been used to predict around 57 complete and partial virophage genomes and in December 2019 to identify 328 high-quality (complete or near-complete) genomes from diverse habitats including the human gut, plant rhizosphere, and terrestrial subsurface, from 27 distinct taxonomic clades.
virophage	For example, the discovery of the virophage associated with the Samba virus decreased the viruses concentration in the host while the virophage was replicating using the giant virus.
virophage	Additionally, virophage genomes identified from metagenomes have been classified together with the isolate virophages into 27 distinct clades with consistent genome length, gene content, and habitat distribution.
virophage	Some fragmentary virophage sequences were additionally reported in a Loki's Castle metagenome.
virophage	discovered a new virophage species by metagenomical analysis, the Ace-Lake-Mavirus (ALM), similar to a short time ago in Organic Lake (OLV) and also in Yellowstone Lake (YSLV).
virophage	ALM belongs to the virophage genus Mavirus; as a virophage, it is a satellite virus that (as a parasite), when co-infected with a helper virus (host), impairs its ability to replicate.
virophage	In 2011, a new species of virophage (a satellite virus that impairs the ability of its co-infective host virus to replicate) was discovered in Organic Lake, the Organic Lake virophage.
virophage	A virophage is similar to bacteriophage viruses, which infect and sicken bacteria, but virophages infect viruses.
virophage	These factories are also the primary targets of the virophage Mavirus, which utilizes CroV machinery to replicate.
virophage	"Discovered in 2013 in Tunisia, infecting ""Acanthamoeba polyphaga"" amoebae, Zamilon most closely resembles Sputnik, the first virophage to be discovered."
virophage	This appears to be a consequence of a rudimentary immune system of the helper virus, termed MIMIVIRE (mimivirus virophage resistance element), akin to the CRISPR-Cas pathway.
virophage	As of 2015, Zamilon is one of three virophages to have been isolated physically, the others being Sputnik and Mavirus; several other virophage DNAs have been discovered using metagenomics but have not been characterised physically.
virophage	"Zamilon virophage has been classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses into the species ""Mimivirus-dependent virus Zamilon"" within the genus ""Sputnikvirus"" in the family ""Lavidaviridae""."
virophage	The virophage most closely related to Zamilon is Sputnik, with which it shares 76% sequence identity, although part of the Zamilon sequence is reversed compared with Sputnik.
virophage	"One Zamilon ORF additionally shows some similarity to Mavirus, and another to Organic Lake virophage and a ""Phaeocystis globosa"" virophage, which are both associated with algae rather than amoebae."
virophage	"The virophage has subsequently been shown to be capable of replicating in association with Moumouvirus and Monve, two ""Mimiviridae"" from lineage B, as well as with Terra1 and Courdo11 from lineage C; however, it cannot replicate in association with either ""Mimivirus"" or ""Mamavirus"", classified as lineage A."
virophage	Organic Lake virophage (OLV) is a double-stranded DNA virophage (a virus that requires the presence of another virus to replicate itself and in so doing limits the ability of the other virus to replicate).
virophage	The virophage was discovered by Matthias G. Fischer of the University of British Columbia while he was working on Cafeteria roenbergensis virus as part of his PhD.
virophage	The virophage may improve the recovery and survival of the host organism.

penton	240 hexon proteins make up the bulk of the capsid, while twelve penton bases cap the icosahedron's corners.
penton	The penton bases are associated with protruding fibers that aid in attachment to the host cell via the receptor on its surface.
penton	This is followed by a secondary interaction, where a motif in the penton base protein (see capsomere) interacts with an integrin molecule.
penton	The penton complex, formed by the peripentonal hexons and penton base (holding in place a fibre), lie at each of the 12 vertices.

tropism	In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the viral surface proteins to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.
tropism	Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.
tropism	Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a tropism switch, where the virus glycoprotein gp120 initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell.
tropism	Apart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific transcription factors.
tropism	An example would be the JC polyomavirus, in which its tropism is limited to glial cells since its enhancer is only active in glial cells, and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.
tropism	Acute infections have high morbidity and tropism for the salivary, lachrymal and Harderian glands.
tropism	Vector engineering can increase AAV transduction efficiency (by optimizing the transgene cassette), vector tropism (using capsid engineering) and the ability of the capsid and transgene to avoid the host immune response (by genetically modifying these components), as well as optimize the large-scale production of AAV

emulator	It also says nothing about timing constraints; if the emulator does not perform as quickly as it did using the original hardware, the software inside the emulation may run much more slowly (possibly triggering timer interrupts that alter behavior).
emulator	In contrast, some other platforms have had very little use of direct hardware addressing, such as an emulator for the PlayStation 4.
emulator	If a math coprocessor is not installed or present on the CPU, when the CPU executes any co-processor instruction it will make a determined interrupt (coprocessor not available), calling the math emulator routines.
emulator	As computers and global computer networks continued to advance and emulator developers grew more skilled in their work, the length of time between the commercial release of a console and its successful emulation began to shrink.
emulator	Typically, an emulator is divided into modules that correspond roughly to the emulated computer's subsystems.
emulator	Most often, an emulator will be composed of the following modules:
emulator	The emulator allows the user to have access to any kind of application or operating system on a current platform, while the software runs as it did in its original environment.
emulator	Practically speaking, when a certain application is released in a new version, rather than address compatibility issues and migration for every digital object created in the previous version of that application, one could create an emulator for the application, allowing access to all of said digital objects.
emulator	The paradox is that the emulation and the emulator have to be made to work on future computers.
emulator	"Dr. Chlamtac is the co-founder and past President of Consip, the first network emulator company, and of ""BCN System House Ltd."" which was merged into ""KFKI System Integration Co. Ltd."", one of the largest system integrator companies in central Europe."
emulator	In the context of end-user software, the terminal emulator xterm also has a significant quantity of notable features, including compatibility with the X Window System, the ability to emulate a VT220 and VT320 terminal with ANSI color, and the ability to input escape sequences using a computer mouse or other similar device, and the ability to run on multiple different Unix-like operating systems (e.g.
emulator	"The Archimedes came with 65Arthur, an emulator which ""BYTE"" stated ""lets many programs for the BBC Micro run""; other emulators exist for many operating systems."
emulator	A video game console emulator is a type of emulator that allows a computing device to emulate a video game console's hardware and play its games on the emulating platform.
emulator	The code and data of a game are typically supplied to the emulator by means of a ROM file (a copy of game cartridge data) or an ISO image (a copy of optical media), which are created by either specialized tools for game cartridges, or regular optical drives reading the data.
emulator	The first such recognized emulator was released around 1996, being one of the prototype projects that eventually merged into the SNES9X product.
emulator	A curiosity was also Yuji Naka's unreleased NES emulator for the Genesis, possibly marking the first instance of a software emulator running on a console.
emulator	Additionally, as the Internet gained wider availability, distribution of both emulator software and ROM images became more common, helping to popularize emulators.
emulator	Legal attention was drawn to emulations with the release of UltraHLE, an emulator for the Nintendo 64 released in 1999 while the Nintendo 64 was still Nintendo's primary console - its next console, the GameCube, would not be released until 2001.
emulator	UltraHLE was the first emulator to be released for a current console, and it was seen to have some effect on Nintendo 64 sales, though to what degree compared with diminishing sales on the aging consoles was not clear.
emulator	Nintendo pursued legal action to stop the emulator project, and while the original authors ceased development, the project continued by others who had gotten the source code.
emulator	Additionally, the development of some emulators has contributed to improved resources for homebrew software development for certain consoles, such as was the case with VisualBoyAdvance, a Game Boy Advance emulator that was noted by author Casey O'Donnell as having contributed to the development of tools for the console that were seen as superior to even those provided by Nintendo, so much so that even some licensed game developers used the tools to develop games for the console.
emulator	An emulator is created typically through reverse engineering of the hardware information as to avoid any possible conflicts with non-public intellectual property.
emulator	For example, in 2020, a large trove of information related to Nintendo's consoles was leaked, and teams working on Nintendo console emulators such as the Dolphin emulator for GameCube and Wii stated they were staying far away from the leaked information to avoid tainting their project.
emulator	Once an emulator is written, it then requires a copy of the game software to be obtained, a step that may have legal consequences.
emulator	The emulator subsequently uses the BIOS dump to mimic the hardware while the ROM dump (with any patches) is used to replicate the game software.
emulator	As computers and global computer networks continued to advance and become more popular, emulator developers grew more skilled in their work, the length of time between the commercial release of a console and its successful emulation began to shrink.
emulator	However, emulator developers cannot incorporate code that may have been embedded within the hardware BIOS, nor ship the BIOS image with their emulators.
emulator	The Federal Trade Commission has since issued an advisory warning users to avoid downloading such software, in response to reports of a purported Nintendo Switch emulator released by various websites as a front for a survey scam.
emulator	Each game is distributed with a dedicated emulator tweaked to run the game as well as possible.
emulator	The PlayStation 3 uses software emulation to play original PlayStation titles, and the PlayStation Store sells games that run through an emulator within the machine.
emulator	When an emulator was added to provide PC DOS compatibility, the system was renamed Concurrent DOS, which later became Multiuser DOS, of which REAL/32 is the latest incarnation.
emulator	An emulator is able to run at a much higher speed than the original BK.
emulator	The command is also available in the open source MS-DOS emulator DOSBox and in the EFI shell.
emulator	It is also available in the open source MS-DOS emulator DOSBox.

regular expression	NOTE: An application using a library for regular expression support does not necessarily offer the full set of features of the library, e.g.
regular expression	Julia is garbage-collected, uses eager evaluation, and includes efficient libraries for floating-point calculations, linear algebra, random number generation, and regular expression matching.
regular expression	»&gt; # A regular expression matching a quoted string with possible backslash quoting
regular expression	A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; sometimes referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text.
regular expression	For speed, Thompson implemented regular expression matching by just-in-time compilation (JIT) to IBM 7094 code on the Compatible Time-Sharing System, an important early example of JIT compilation.
regular expression	"He later added this capability to the Unix editor ed, which eventually led to the popular search tool grep's use of regular expressions (""grep"" is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the ed editor: codice_1 meaning ""Global search for Regular Expression and Print matching lines"")."
regular expression	Software projects that have adopted Spencer's Tcl regular expression implementation include PostgreSQL.
regular expression	Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning.
regular expression	"A very simple case of a regular expression in this syntax is to locate a word spelled two different ways in a text editor, the regular expression codice_7 matches both ""serialise"" and ""serialize""."
regular expression	A regex processor translates a regular expression in the above syntax into an internal representation that can be executed and matched against a string representing the text being searched in.
regular expression	"The picture shows the NFA scheme codice_8 obtained from the regular expression codice_9, where ""s"" denotes a simpler regular expression in turn, which has already been recursively translated to the NFA ""N""(""s"")."
regular expression	However, there can be many ways to write a regular expression for the same set of strings: for example, codice_11 also specifies the same set of three strings in this example.
regular expression	However, it can make a regular expression much more concise—eliminating a single complement operator can cause a double exponential blow-up of its length.
regular expression	"On the one hand, a regular expression describing ""L""4 is given by"
regular expression	However, a regular expression to answer the same problem of divisibility by 11 is at least multiple megabytes in length.
regular expression	As seen in many of the examples above, there is more than one way to construct a regular expression to achieve the same results.
regular expression	Every regular expression can be written solely in terms of the Kleene star and set unions over finite words.
regular expression	"Many features found in virtually all modern regular expression libraries provide an expressive power that exceeds the [[regular language]]s. For example, many implementations allow grouping subexpressions with parentheses and recalling the value they match in the same expression (""&lt;templatestyles src=""Template:Visible anchor/styles.css"" /&gt;backreferences"")."
regular expression	This has led to a nomenclature where the term regular expression has different meanings in [[formal language|formal language theory]] and pattern matching.
regular expression	"Constructing the DFA for a regular expression of size ""m"" has the time and memory cost of [[Big O notation|""O""]](2""m""), but it can be run on a string of size ""n"" in time ""O""(""n"")."
regular expression	"Formally, given examples of strings in a regular language, and perhaps also given examples of strings ""not"" in that regular language, it is possible to induce a grammar for the language, i.e., a regular expression that generates that language."
regular expression	For example, the set of examples {1, 10, 100}, and negative set (of counterexamples) {11, 1001, 101, 0} can be used to induce the regular expression 1⋅0* (1 followed by zero or more 0s).
regular expression	In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular language (also called a rational language) is a formal language that can be defined by a regular expression, in the strict sense in theoretical computer science (as opposed to many modern regular expression engines, which are augmented with features that allow the recognition of non-regular languages).
regular expression	"&lt;templatestyles src=""Template:Blockquote/styles.css"" /&gt;The SGML ""model group"" notation was deliberately designed to resemble the regular expression notation of automata theory, because automata theory provides a theoretical foundation for some aspects of the notion of conformance to a content model."
regular expression	Several modern programming languages support tags as primitive token types, or now support Unicode and regular expression pattern-matching.
regular expression	Many SH3-binding epitopes of proteins have a consensus sequence that can be represented as a regular expression or Short linear motif:
regular expression	The syntax for sed, notably the use of codice_1 for pattern matching, and codice_2 for substitution, originated with ed, the precursor to sed, which was in common use at the time, and the regular expression syntax has influenced other languages, notably ECMAScript and Perl.
regular expression	minised was used by the GNU Project until the GNU Project wrote a new version of sed based on the new GNU regular expression library.
regular expression	This example uses some of the following regular expression metacharacters (sed supports the full range of regular expressions):
regular expression	Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the mid-1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its powerful regular expression and string parsing abilities.
regular expression	Perl 2, released in June 1988, featured a better regular expression engine.
regular expression	The first few languages found by are described in the following, by means of giving a regular expression for each language:
regular expression	"The remaining, more difficult part, is to prove that for formula_3 there is no equivalent regular expression of star height less than ""n""; a proof is given in ."
regular expression	Again, a rigorous proof is needed for the fact that formula_3 does not admit an equivalent regular expression of lower star height.
regular expression	Perl is particularly noted for its regular expression use, and many other languages and applications implement Perl compatible regular expressions.
regular expression	Regular expressions also receives some improvements, including a faster, memoized matching algorithm to protect against certain ReDoS attacks, and configurable timeouts for regular expression matching.
regular expression	By comparison, some popular Unix text editors such as vi and Emacs provide a wider range of features than Pico; including regular expression search and replace, and working with multiple files at the same time.
regular expression	This grammar describes the same language as the regular expression a*bc*, viz.
regular expression	"A somewhat longer but more explicit extended right-regular grammar ""G"" for the same regular expression is given by ""N"" = {S, A, B, C}, Σ = {a, b, c}, where ""P"" consists of the following rules:"
regular expression	Another more complex type of search is regular expression searching, where the user constructs a pattern of characters or other symbols, and any match to the pattern should fulfill the search.
regular expression	"For example, to catch both the American English word ""color"" and the British equivalent ""colour"", instead of searching for two different literal strings, one might use a regular expression such as:"
regular expression	GNU nano implements several features that Pico lacks, including syntax highlighting, line numbers, regular expression search and replace, line-by-line scrolling, multiple buffers, indenting groups of lines, rebindable key support, and the undoing and redoing of edit changes.
regular expression	These grammars allow nesting rules to be defined using the Oniguruma regular expression library, and then assigned specific “scopes”: compound labels which identify them for coloration.
regular expression	The firewall code in Apple's macOS is based on OpenBSD's PF firewall code, Android's Bionic C standard library is based on OpenBSD code, LLVM uses OpenBSD's regular expression library, and Windows 10 uses OpenSSH (OpenBSD Secure Shell) with LibreSSL.
regular expression	A quite different Kleene algebra can be used to implement the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, computing the shortest path's length for every two vertices of a weighted directed graph, by Kleene's algorithm, computing a regular expression for every two states of a deterministic finite automaton.
regular expression	In 1997, Hazel replaced Exim's POSIX regular expression library written by Henry Spencer with a new library he developed called PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions).
regular expression	Since UNCs start with two backslashes, and the backslash is also used for string escaping and in regular expressions, this can result in extreme cases of leaning toothpick syndrome: an escaped string for a regular expression matching a UNC begins with 8 backslashes – codice_12 – because the string and regular expression both require escaping.
regular expression	This can be simplified by using raw strings, as in C#'s codice_13 or Python's codice_14, or regular expression literals, as in Perl's codice_15.
regular expression	The name comes from a command in the Unix text editor ed that takes the form codice_1 meaning search globally for a regular expression and print lines where instances are found.
regular expression	Note that the constant is independent of the length of the token, the length of the regular expression and the size of the DFA.
regular expression	"The slash is also used as the default regular expression delimiter, so to be used literally in the expression, it must be escaped with a ""back""slash codice_2, leading to frequent escaped slashes represented as codice_3."
regular expression	"A similar phenomenon occurs for DOS/Windows paths, where the backslash is used as a path separator, requiring a doubled backslash codice_6 – this can then be ""re""-escaped for a regular expression inside an escaped string, requiring codice_7 to match a single backslash."
regular expression	In extreme cases, such as a regular expression in an escaped string, matching a Uniform Naming Convention path (which begins codice_6) requires 8 backslashes codice_9 due to 2 backslashes each being double-escaped.
regular expression	Consider the following Perl regular expression intended to match URIs that identify files under the codice_10 directory of an FTP site:
regular expression	by K. Kosako is a BSD licensed regular expression library that supports a variety of character encodings.
regular expression	The Ruby programming language, in version 1.9, as well as PHP's multi-byte string module (since PHP5), use Oniguruma as their regular expression engine.
regular expression	TSE supports a Pascal-based macro language (SemWare Application Language or SAL), regular expression search and replace, keystroke recording and playback, full undo and redo, shortcut key assignment (both as configuration and on the fly) that allow extensive modification of the functionality of the text editor, and other features.
regular expression	This version introduces top-level , allowing the keyword to be used at the top level of modules; new class elements: public and private instance fields, public and private static fields, private instance methods and accessors, and private static methods and accessors; static blocks inside classes, to perform per-class evaluation initialization; the syntax, to test for presence of private fields on objects; regular expression match indices via the flag, which provides start and end indices for matched substrings; the property on objects, which can be used to record a causation chain in errors; the at method for Strings, Arrays, and TypedArrays, which allows relative indexing; and , a convenient alternative to .
regular expression	For example, using Σ = {0,1}, the regular expression (0+1+ε)⋅(0+1) denotes the set of all binary numbers with one or two digits (leading zero allowed), while 1⋅(0+1)*⋅0 denotes the (infinite) set of all even binary numbers (no leading zeroes).
regular expression	"Given a set of strings (also called ""positive examples""), the ""task of regular language induction"" is to come up with a regular expression that denotes a set containing all of them."
regular expression	"As an example, given {1, 10, 100}, a ""natural"" description could be the regular expression 1⋅0*, corresponding to the informal characterization ""a 1 followed by arbitrarily many (maybe even none) 0's""."
regular expression	"Some approaches work in an extended setting where also a set of ""negative example"" strings is given; then, a regular expression is to be found that generates all of the positive, but none of the negative examples."
regular expression	"For example, the singleton input set {""aabbaabb""} leads to an automaton corresponding to the regular expression (""a""+⋅""b""+)*."
regular expression	"For example, ""F"" = {""ad"", ""read"", ""reread"" } has ""l"" = 6 and a cover automaton corresponding to the regular expression (""r""⋅""e"")*⋅""a""⋅""d""."
regular expression	Given an input set of strings, he builds step by step a tree with each branch labelled by a reduced regular expression accepting a prefix of some input strings, and each node labelled with the set of lengths of accepted prefixes.
regular expression	Therefore, if one wants to apply some filter (e. g. a regular expression written in UTF-8) to UTF-8 strings that will later be passed to a decoder that allows invalid byte sequences, one should canonicalize the strings before passing them to the filter.
regular expression	Each field in the specification has a regular expression associated with it.
regular expression	The regular expression acts as a constraint on the field: if it matches, the field value is legal and if it fails to match, the field and the PAD file as a whole do not conform to specification.
regular expression	In language controlled form, this grammar is simply formula_27 (where formula_28 is a regular expression denoting the set of all sequences of production rules).
regular expression	The basic regular expression search implementation is rudimentary, but if compiled with C++11 support Scintilla can support the runtime's regular expression engine.
regular expression	Scintilla's regular expression library can also be replaced or avoided with direct buffer access.
regular expression	It also has features to process find rules which implement a similar concept to regular expressions, although the pattern expression syntax is more English-like than the regular expression syntax used in Perl and other languages like the Ruby programming language, both of which are more widely used than OmniMark.
regular expression	The text processing of a regular expression is a virtual editing machine, having a primitive programming language that has named registers (identifiers), and named positions in the sequence of characters comprising the text.
regular expression	The results of a text processing step are sometimes only hopeful, and the attempted mechanism is often subject to multiple drafts through visual feedback, until the regular expression or markup language details, or until the utility options, are fully mastered.
regular expression	In addition to filtering by log level and regular expression matching on the message string, Log4j 2 added burst filters, time filters, filtering by other log event attributes like Markers or Thread Context Map and JSR 223 script filters.
regular expression	JavaScriptCore is originally derived from KDE's JavaScript engine (KJS) library (which is part of the KDE project) and the PCRE regular expression library.
regular expression	BBCode is typically implemented by applying a series of regular expression string-replace operations upon the input.
regular expression	When extracting links from a page, the user may choose to download only specific files (for example: all PDFs) using wildcard or regular expression inclusive filters.
regular expression	"Also, if ""L"" is described by a regular expression of length ""n"", there is a regular expression of length O(""n""3) describing ""shift""(""L"")."
regular expression	While the user interface of the editor is reminiscent of DOS editors, it also includes the typical Unix editor features such as internal command history, tab completion in file selection menus, regular expression search system and the ability to filter (pipe) arbitrary blocks of text through any external command.
regular expression	print $string1 =~ m@http://@; # match using alternate regular expression delimiter
regular expression	For instance, the command line utility grep has a regular expression syntax which matches patterns in lines of text.
regular expression	While enumerative methods often resort to regular expression representation of binding sites, PSFM and their formal treatment under Information Theory methods are the representation of choice for both deterministic and stochastic methods.
regular expression	Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) is a library written in C, which implements a regular expression engine, inspired by the capabilities of the Perl programming language.
regular expression	PCRE's syntax is much more powerful and flexible than either of the POSIX regular expression flavors (BRE, ERE) and than that of many other regular-expression libraries.
regular expression	"With the exception of the above points, PCRE is capable of passing the tests in the Perl ""codice_6"" file, one of the main syntax-level regression tests for Perl's regular expression engine."
regular expression	Languages that have been derided as write-only include APL, C/C++, Perl, Forth, Scala and Lisp, as well as Dynamic debugging technique (DDT), Text Editor and Corrector (TECO), Mathematica, IGOR Pro, Rust, sed and the regular expression syntax used in various languages.
regular expression	In dynamic languages, the cases may not be limited to constant expressions, and might extend to pattern matching, as in the shell script example on the right, where the '*)' implements the default case as a regular expression matching any string.
regular expression	"Given a finite alphabet ""A"" of symbols, a generalized regular expression ""R"" denotes a possibly infinite set of finite-length strings over the alphabet ""A"", called the language of ""R"", denoted ""L""(""R"")."
regular expression	"A generalized regular expression can be one of the following (where ""a"" is a symbol of the alphabet ""A"", and ""R"" and ""S"" are generalized regular expressions):"
regular expression	"For any given generalized regular expression ""R"" and any string ""u"", the derivative ""u""−1""R"" is again a generalized regular expression (denoting the language ""u""−1""L""(""R""))."
regular expression	"Here, ν(""R"") is an auxiliary function yielding a generalized regular expression that evaluates to the empty string ""ε"" if ""R"" 's language contains ""ε"", and otherwise evaluates to ∅."
regular expression	"A string ""u"" is a member of the string set denoted by a generalized regular expression ""R"" if and only if ε is a member of the string set denoted by the derivative ""u""−1""R""."
regular expression	"Considering all the derivatives of a fixed generalized regular expression ""R"" results in only finitely many different languages."
regular expression	Derivatives are also effectively computable for recursively defined equations with regular expression operators, which are equivalent to context-free grammars.
regular expression	"Since there is no state numbered higher than ""n"", the regular expression ""R"" represents the set of all strings that take ""M"" from its start state ""q""0 to ""q""""j""."
regular expression	"If ""F"" = { ""q""1...,""q""""f"" } is the set of accept states, the regular expression ""R"" | ... | ""R"" represents the language accepted by ""M""."
regular expression	"Another way to understand the operation of the algorithm is as an ""elimination method"", where the states from 0 to ""n"" are successively removed: when state ""k"" is removed, the regular expression ""R"", which describes the words that label a path from state ""i""&gt;""k"" to state ""j""&gt;""k"", is rewritten into ""R"" so as to take into account the possibility of going via the ""eliminated"" state ""k""."
regular expression	"Therefore, the length of the regular expression representing the language accepted by ""M"" is at most (4""n""+1(6""s""+7)""f"" - ""f"" - 3) symbols, where ""f"" denotes the number of final states."
regular expression	This exponential blowup is inevitable, because there exist families of DFAs for which any equivalent regular expression must be of exponential size.

pipe	The upset or larger diameter section of a pipe connection can be pulled or pushed through a closed annular element without damage and while still maintaining a gas tight seal.
pipe	Generally, the maximum pressure for stripping pipe through an annular is equal to 40% of the maximum static pressure rating dry or 60% if the pipe is lubricated as it is being stripped through the annular.
pipe	Because snubbing is normally done under pressure, initially, the weight of pipe in wellbore is less than the force due to the wellbore pressure.
pipe	"This is described as ""light-pipe"": downward force is required on the pipe to force it in against resistance."
pipe	"Once a sufficient amount of pipe has been run into the hole, the weight becomes sufficient to overpower the wellbore pressure and the pipe naturally wants to fall in the hole; this is ""heavy-pipe""."
pipe	At this point, the snubbing mechanism is changed over to the one which provides upward force to hold the pipe and lower it controllably into the well.
pipe	When pulling out of hole, upward force is initially used to lift the pipe until the equilibrium point, henceforth downward force is used to prevent wellbore pressure from blowing the light-pipe out of hole.
pipe	While pulling out of hole, one stripping ram was not opened sufficiently and a collar on the pipe string caught on the ram.
pipe	The excessive force applied to the pipe caused it to break apart, dropping the string below the failure into the well.
pipe	In the case above, adequate supervision could have prevented this dramatic consequence of operator error by limiting the hydraulic force allowable to be an applied to a level below what was required to part the pipe string.

executable	The custom installer with the LAN patch introduces input lag on Windows 10 which can be averted by using the executable of the original version from the CD.
executable	No broad standard for pseudocode syntax exists, as a program in pseudocode is not an executable program; however, certain limited standards exist (such as for academic assessment).
executable	Unlike in Plan 9, the path environment variable of Unix shells should be set to include the additional directories whose executable files need to be added as commands.

executable	"The tester will often have access to both ""the source code and the executable binary."""
executable	"Such a script file may be made directly executable from the command line by prepending it with a ""shebang line"" containing the sed command and assigning the executable permission to the file."
executable	The file may then be made executable by the current user with the codice_41 command:
executable	The plug-in executable could call the editor to inspect and change the text.
executable	"Douglas Crockford, known for his involvement in the development of JavaScript, has described Rebol as ""a more modern language, but with some very similar ideas to Lisp, in that it's all built upon a representation of data which is then executable as programs"" and as one of JSON's influences."
executable	"Extended editions, such as ""Rebol/Command"" 2.7.8 or ""Rebol/SDK"" 2.7.8 require a paid license; they add features like ODBC data access, and the option to create standalone executable files."
executable	Perl is implemented as a core interpreter, written in C, together with a large collection of modules, written in Perl and C. s of 2010[ [update]], the interpreter is 150,000 lines of C code and compiles to a 1 MB executable on typical machine architectures.
executable	Adam Kennedy's PPI project focused on parsing Perl code as a document (retaining its integrity as a document), instead of parsing Perl as executable code (that not even Perl itself can always do).
executable	A Perl executable is included in several Windows Resource kits in the directory with other scripting tools.
executable	This was sufficiently difficult that it was done for only a few of the most-important and most widely used databases, and it restricted the resulting codice_10 executable to using just one database interface at a time.
executable	Most application software is distributed in a form that includes only executable files.
executable	"For the purpose of clarity ""source code"" is taken to mean any fully executable description of a software system."
executable	It is therefore so construed as to include machine code, very high level languages and executable graphical representations of systems.

executable	In this case the program is treated as both executable code, and as data to be manipulated.
executable	A stored procedure is executable code that is associated with, and generally stored in, the database.
executable	This has the advantage for a cracker to not include a large executable in a release when only a few bytes are changed.
executable	This is accomplished by reverse engineering the compiled program code using a debugger such as SoftICE, OllyDbg, GDB, or MacsBug until the software cracker reaches the subroutine that contains the primary method of protecting the software (or by disassembling an executable file with a program such as IDA).
executable	These cracks are usually programs that alter the program executable and sometimes the .dll or .so linked to the application and the process of altering the original binary files is called patching.
executable	"Advanced reverse engineering for protections such as SecuROM, SafeDisc, StarForce, or Denuvo requires a cracker, or many crackers to spend much more time studying the protection, eventually finding every flaw within the protection code, and then coding their own tools to ""unwrap"" the protection automatically from executable (.EXE) and library (.DLL) files."
executable	It is just Turing complete in principle, as memory allocation in a programming language is allowed to fail, which means the programming language can be Turing complete when ignoring failed memory allocations, but the compiled programs executable on a real computer cannot.
executable	Object files can in turn be linked to form an executable file or library file.
executable	In order to be used, object code must either be placed in an executable file, a library file, or an object file.
executable	Assemblers can also assemble directly to machine code executable files without the object intermediary step.
executable	Most compilers will not catch this at compile time, and instead compile this to executable code that will crash:

executable	PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located.
executable	When a command is entered in a command shell or a system call is made by a program to execute a program, the system first searches the current working directory and then searches the path, examining each directory from left to right, looking for an executable filename that matches the command name given.
executable	Other executable filename extensions can be registered with the system as well.
executable	Once a matching executable file is found, the system spawns a new process which runs it.
executable	A decompiler is a computer program that translates an executable file to high-level source code.
executable	While disassemblers translate an executable into assembly language, decompilers go a step further and translate the code into a higher level language such as C or Java, requiring more sophisticated techniques.
executable	"The term ""decompiler"" is most commonly applied to a program which translates executable programs (the output from a compiler) into source code in a (relatively) high level language which, when compiled, will produce an executable whose behavior is the same as the original executable program."
executable	By comparison, a disassembler translates an executable program into assembly language (and an assembler could be used for assembling it back into an executable program).
executable	The Free Software Foundation (which holds the copyright of several notable GPL-licensed software products and of the license text itself) asserts that an executable that uses a dynamically linked library is indeed a derivative work.

executable	Some viruses, called polymorphic viruses, will employ a means of encryption inside an executable in which the virus is encrypted under certain events, such as the virus scanner being disabled for updates or the computer being rebooted.
executable	For this reason, many viruses attach themselves to executable files that may be part of legitimate programs (see code injection).
executable	"For example, an executable may be created and named ""picture.png.exe"", in which the user sees only ""picture.png"" and therefore assumes that this file is a digital image and most likely is safe, yet when opened, it runs the executable on the client machine."
executable	Many users install antivirus software that can detect and eliminate known viruses when the computer attempts to download or run the executable file (which may be distributed as an email attachment, or on USB flash drives, for example).
executable	Once the system has been restored, precautions must be taken to avoid reinfection from any restored executable files.
executable	"Giorgio Maone wrote in 2008 that ""if today’s malware runs mostly runs on Windows because it’s the commonest executable platform, tomorrow’s will likely run on the Web, for the very same reason."

colormap	The Parula colormap also has the effect that when plotted in grayscale, the colors also map to a smooth gradient from dark to light grey.
spawn	"In most levels, minor enemies will spawn from Time Bubbles over time (usually those to do with the level theming itself) and when defeated, they will leave behind various items such as Bubble Gun ammo (in either green or red; the latter can temporarily grant the bubbles with homing capabilities), hearts that will restore health and ""Chronon's Gift"" (a red skull and crossbones) which will cause damage to the player if picked up."

kernel	"Cohen's class of bilinear time-frequency representations is a class of ""smoothed"" Wigner–Ville distributions, employing a smoothing kernel that can reduce sensitivity of the distribution to noise and suppresses cross-components, at the expense of smearing the distribution in time and frequency."
kernel	It is a smoothed Wigner–Ville distribution with the smoothing kernel equal to the Wigner–Ville distribution of the analysis window.
kernel	where formula_5 is a (real-valued) lowpass kernel function, like the window function in the short-time Fourier transform.
kernel	where formula_31 is the Wigner–Ville distribution of formula_1, and formula_33 is the kernel function that defines the distribution.
kernel	I/O request packets (IRPs) are kernel mode structures that are used by Windows Driver Model (WDM) and Windows NT device drivers to communicate with each other and with the operating system.

kernel	JX is a microkernel operating system with both the kernel and applications implemented using the Java programming language.
kernel	"JX is implemented as an extended Java virtual machine (the ""JX Core""), adding support to the Java system for necessary features such as protection domains and hardware access, along with a number of components written in Java that provide kernel facilities to applications running on the computer."
kernel	Thus formula_39 lies in the kernel of the map to formula_40, which is formula_44, but that is also torsion-free, so formula_45.
kernel	In contrast, symptoms of kernel necrosis, which is caused by large hemipterans, are dry, punky, brown areas in the kernel.

kernel	Stigmatomycosis and kernel necrosis are worse in orchards irrigated by sprinklers than in those irrigated by drip, microjets, or flood.
kernel	This avoids copying unwanted packets from the operating system kernel to the process, greatly improving performance.
kernel	The Linux kernel provides an extended version of the BPF filtering mechanism, called eBPF, which uses a JIT mechanism, and which is used for packet filtering, as well as for other purposes in the kernel.
kernel	In 2007, Robert Watson and Christian Peron added zero-copy buffer extensions to the BPF implementation in the FreeBSD operating system, allowing kernel packet capture in the device driver interrupt handler to write directly to user process memory in order to avoid the requirement for two copies for all packet data received via the BPF device.
kernel	Kernel-mode interpreters for that same virtual machine language are used in raw data link layer mechanisms in other operating systems, such as Tru64 Unix, and for socket filters in the Linux kernel and in the WinPcap and Npcap packet capture mechanism.
kernel	Since version 3.18, the Linux kernel includes an extended BPF virtual machine with ten 64-bit registers, termed extended BPF (eBPF).
kernel	Since kernel version 3.19, eBPF filters can be attached to sockets, and, since kernel version 4.1, to traffic control classifiers for the ingress and egress networking data path.
kernel	Nowadays, the Linux kernel runs eBPF only and loaded cBPF bytecode is transparently translated into an eBPF representation in the kernel before program execution.
kernel	A user-mode interpreter for BPF is provided with the libpcap/WinPcap/Npcap implementation of the pcap API, so that, when capturing packets on systems without kernel-mode support for that filtering mechanism, packets can be filtered in user mode; code using the pcap API will work on both types of systems, although, on systems where the filtering is done in user mode, all packets, including those that will be filtered out, are copied from the kernel to user space.
kernel	In August 2003, SCO Group publicly claimed that the Linux kernel was infringing Unix code which they owned.
kernel	The Spectre attack could leverage the Linux kernel's eBPF interpreter or JIT compiler to extract data from other kernel processes.

kernel	The dm-crypt device mapper target resides entirely in kernel space, and is only concerned with encryption of the block device – it does not interpret any data itself.
kernel	dm-crypt can also be configured to provide pre-boot authentication through an initrd, thus encrypting all the data on a computer – except the bootloader, the kernel and the initrd image itself.
kernel	Support for ESSIV (encrypted salt-sector initialization vector) was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.10, LRW in 2.6.20 and XTS in 2.6.24.
kernel	"Crypted FS support include LUKS volumes, loop-AES and since Linux kernel 3.13, the TrueCrypt target called ""tcw""."
kernel	It can be viewed as a particular type of positive-definite kernel where the underlying set has the additional group structure.
kernel	"In other words, a function ""F"": ""G"" → ""L""(""H"") is said to be a positive-definite function if the kernel ""K"": ""G"" × ""G"" → ""L""(""H"") defined by ""K""(""s"", ""t"") = ""F""(""s""−1""t"") is a positive-definite kernel."
kernel	"The corresponding positive kernel ""K""(""s"", ""t"") = ""F""(""s""−1""t"") defines a (possibly degenerate) inner product on ""C""00(""G"", ""H"")."
kernel	"The kernel ""K""(""n"", ""m"") = ""F""(""m"" − ""n"") is called a kernel of ""Toeplitz"" type, by analogy with Toeplitz matrices."
kernel	"One can show that the kernel ""K""(""n"", ""m"") is positive if and only if ""T"" is a contraction."
kernel	It is built as a kernel loadable module (KLD) which allows it to run inside the FreeBSD kernel.
kernel	Typically a Gaussian kernel on the distance to the current estimate is used, formula_3.
kernel	Although the mean shift algorithm has been widely used in many applications, a rigid proof for the convergence of the algorithm using a general kernel in a high dimensional space is still not known.
kernel	However, sufficient conditions for a general kernel function to have finite stationary (or isolated) points have not been provided.
kernel	Let formula_15 be a flat kernel that is the characteristic function of the formula_16-ball in formula_14,
kernel	One of the simplest approaches is to just smooth the data, e.g., by convolving it with a fixed kernel of width formula_21,
kernel	"where formula_23 are the input samples and formula_24 is the kernel function (or ""Parzen window"")."
kernel	"A function formula_37 is said to be a kernel if there exists a ""profile"", formula_38 , such that"
kernel	The two most frequently used kernel profiles for mean shift are:
kernel	Mean-shift is a hill climbing algorithm which involves shifting this kernel iteratively to a higher density region until convergence.
kernel	At every iteration the kernel is shifted to the centroid or the mean of the points within it.
kernel	In this case if a Gaussian kernel is chosen instead of a flat kernel, then every point will first be assigned a weight which will decay exponentially as the distance from the kernel's center increases.
kernel	"Two contractions ""T""1 and ""T""2 are said to be quasi-similar when there are bounded operators ""A"", ""B"" with trivial kernel and dense range such that"
kernel	Another way of looking at the nilpotence of the BRST operator is to say that its image (the space of BRST exact forms) lies entirely within its kernel (the space of BRST closed forms).
kernel	"(The ""true"" Lagrangian, presumed to be invariant under local gauge transformations, is in the kernel of the BRST operator but not in its image.)"
kernel	"The preceding argument says that we can limit our universe of initial and final conditions to asymptotic ""states""—field configurations at timelike infinity, where the interaction Lagrangian is ""turned off""—that lie in the kernel of ""QB"" and still obtain a unitary scattering matrix."
kernel	"The expansion of the Dyson series in terms of Feynman diagrams will include vertices that couple ""physical"" particles (those that can appear in asymptotic states of the free Hamiltonian) to ""unphysical"" particles (states of fields that live outside the kernel of ""sB"" or inside the image of ""sB"") and vertices that couple ""unphysical"" particles to one another."
kernel	There are two kinds of quanta in the Fock space of the gauge-fixed Hamiltonian that we expect to lie entirely outside the kernel of the BRST operator: those of the Faddeev–Popov anti-ghost formula_72 and the forward polarized gauge boson.
kernel	A main problem when applying this operator at a single scale, however, is that the operator response is strongly dependent on the relationship between the size of the blob structures in the image domain and the size of the Gaussian kernel used for pre-smoothing.
kernel	In practice, affine invariant interest points can be obtained by applying affine shape adaptation to a blob descriptor, where the shape of the smoothing kernel is iteratively warped to match the local image structure around the blob, or equivalently a local image patch is iteratively warped while the shape of the smoothing kernel remains rotationally symmetric (Lindeberg and Garding 1997; Baumberg 2000; Mikolajczyk and Schmid 2004, Lindeberg 2008).

ALT	Serum AST level, serum ALT (alanine transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health.
ALT	The difference is that ALT is found predominantly in the liver, with clinically negligible quantities found in the kidneys, heart, and skeletal muscle, while AST is found in the liver, heart (cardiac muscle), skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells.
ALT	As a result, ALT is a more specific indicator of liver inflammation than AST, as AST may be elevated also in diseases affecting other organs, such as myocardial infarction, acute pancreatitis, acute hemolytic anemia, severe burns, acute renal disease, musculoskeletal diseases, and trauma.

ALT	Serum ALT level, serum AST (aspartate transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health.
ALT	Significantly elevated levels of ALT (SGPT) often suggest the existence of other medical problems such as viral hepatitis, diabetes, congestive heart failure, liver damage, bile duct problems, infectious mononucleosis, or myopathy, so ALT is commonly used as a way of screening for liver problems.
ALT	However, elevated levels of ALT do not automatically mean that medical problems exist.
ALT	Fluctuation of ALT levels is normal over the course of the day, and they can also increase in response to strenuous physical exercise.
ALT	When elevated ALT levels are found in the blood, the possible underlying causes can be further narrowed down by measuring other enzymes.
ALT	For example, elevated ALT levels due to hepatocyte damage can be distinguished from bile duct problems by measuring alkaline phosphatase.
ALT	Also, myopathy-related elevations in ALT should be suspected when the aspartate transaminase (AST) is greater than ALT; the possibility of muscle disease causing elevations in liver tests can be further explored by measuring muscle enzymes, including creatine kinase.
ALT	Many drugs may elevate ALT levels, including zileuton, omega-3 acid ethyl esters (Lovaza), anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, cholesterol medications, some antipsychotics such as risperidone, and anticonvulsants.
ALT	For years, the American Red Cross used ALT testing as part of the battery of tests to ensure the safety of its blood supply by deferring donors with elevated ALT levels.

hyperreality	For the series McCarty constructed a toy hyperreality and used the simulacra of family to explore modern living.
hyperreality	Since 2010, Murata has also created artworks that exploit the hyperreality achievable with the use of digital rendering.
hyperreality	"The postmodern semiotic concept of hyperreality was contentiously coined by Baudrillard in ""Simulacra and Simulation""."
hyperreality	He believes hyperreality goes further than confusing or blending the 'real' with the symbol which represents it; it involves creating a symbol or set of signifiers which represent something that does not actually exist, like Santa Claus.
hyperreality	Baudrillard's idea of hyperreality was heavily influenced by phenomenology, semiotics, and Marshall McLuhan.
hyperreality	"However, Baudrillard's hyperreality theory goes a step further than McLuhan's medium theory: ""There is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined""."
hyperreality	American author Micah Dunham explores the notion of hyperreality further by suggesting that the action of hyperreality is to desire reality and in the attempt to achieve that desire, to fabricate a false reality that is to be consumed as real.
hyperreality	brand X shows that one is fashionable, car Y indicates one's wealth), could be seen as a contributing factor in the creation of hyperreality or the hyperreal condition.
hyperreality	While hyperreality is not a new concept, its effects are more relevant in modern society, incorporating technological advancements like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and neurotechnology (simulated reality).
hyperreality	There are dangers to the use of hyperreality within our culture; individuals may observe and accept hyperreal images as role models when the images don't necessarily represent real physical people.
hyperreality	The dangers of hyperreality are also facilitated by information technologies, which provide tools to dominant powers that seek to encourage it to drive consumption and materialism.
hyperreality	"The concepts most fundamental to hyperreality are those of simulation and the simulacrum, first conceptualized by Jean Baudrillard in his book ""Simulacra and Simulation""."
hyperreality	"The concept of ""hyperstition"" as expounded upon by the English collective Cybernetic Culture Research Unit generalizes the notion of hyperreality to encompass the concept of ""fictional entities that make themselves real."""
hyperreality	The truth was already being called into question with the rise of media and technology, but with the presence of hyperreality being used most and embraced as a new technology, there are a couple of issues or consequences of hyperreality.
hyperreality	Because the truth is threatened, a similar outcome for hyperreality is possible.
hyperreality	There is a strong link between media and the impact that the presence of hyperreality has on its viewers.
hyperreality	As hyperreality captures the inability to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, common media outlets such as news, social media platforms, radio and television contribute to this misconception of true reality.
hyperreality	Descriptions of the impact of hyperreality can be found in popular media.
hyperreality	As media is a social institution that shapes and develops its members within society, the exposure to hyperreality found within these platforms present an everlasting effect.
hyperreality	Baudrillard concludes that exposure to hyperreality over time will lead, from the conservative perspective of the institutions themselves to confusion and chaos, leading toward the destruction of identity, originality and character while ironically still being the mainstay of the institutions.
hyperreality	The hyperreality environment on the internet has shifted dramatically over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that it has an influence on the Italian Stock Exchange in 2021.
hyperreality	The hyperreality created on social media platforms has been regarded as strong and influential enough for its quality and emotion to be translated into social reality, where value is lost and careers are damaged.
hyperreality	"Park Place had developed ""ABC Monday Night Football"" with ""arcade-style, action-heavy"" game play, and its ""Madden"" also emphasized hyperreality compared to the computer version's focus on exact simulation."
hyperreality	Engaging with the notion of hyperreality in the digital age, Tromarama specialises in developing inventive responses to contemporary urban culture spanning multiple media – from stop motion animation and video art to installations and lenticular prints.
hyperreality	habitus — health maintenance organization — hegemony — heterophobia — heterosexuality — hidden curriculum — higher circles — higher education — Hispanic — historical materialism — historical sociology — holocaust — homelessness — homophobia — homosexuality — house work — hunter-gatherer — human ecology — hybridity — hyperreality — hypothesis — honour killing
hyperreality	He has been credited as a pioneer of the 21st century genres hypnagogic pop and vaporwave, with his work exploring themes related to hyperreality and consumer culture.
hyperreality	"""Crossing the Postmodern Divide"" (1992) is a techno-religious book characterized in terms of hyperreality and hyperactivity."
hyperreality	Meanwhile, critics such as Douglas Kellner have challenged Borgmann's distinction between the real and hyperreal and his denigration of hyperreality as problematic.
hyperreality	"So if in the world of merchandise the hyperreality follows another hyperreality... in Busacca's poetry estrangement lays the foundation of her ""spoken word"": a sort of zombie from the cadaver of a dead person: the slaying of her brother ""aldo;"" that which makes this poetry ever more head-on, surreal and metareal, hypochondriac, obsessive, exclusive, maniacal..."
hyperreality	Additionally, ideas about postmodernism and hyperreality inspired those within the neo-geo movement.
scopophilia	"In the opening scene there are repeated references to scopophilia and Spooner asks Hirst if he often hangs ""around Hampstead Heath"" and the pub Jack Straw's Castle, both notorious for homosexual activity in the 1960s and ‘70s."
scopophilia	"In the fields of media studies and feminist film theory, the ""male gaze"" is conceptually related to the behaviors of voyeurism (looking as sexual pleasure), scopophilia (pleasure from looking), and narcissism (pleasure from contemplating one's self)."
scopophilia	Psychologically, fetishistic scopophilia reduces the man's castration anxiety — induced by the presence of women — by fragmenting the woman's personality and hypersexualizing the parts of her body.
scopophilia	Moreover, as an expression of human sexuality, scopophilia refers to the pleasure (sensual and sexual) derived from looking at sexual fetishes and photographs, pornography and naked bodies, etc.
scopophilia	"Accounting for the social signifiers of ""difference"" that lie outside the exclusivity of perpetuated lines of sex-and-sexuality, hooks curated an organic pleasure in looking, which is not related to the scopophilia originally presented and explained in “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema”."
scopophilia	"In his essay ""Horror as Critique in Tell Me Something and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,"" Kyu Hyun Kim writes that ""Tell Me Something"" plays with the idea of scopophilia in order to comment on both male gaze and the horror genre."
scopophilia	"Kim writes that ""Tell Me Something"" directly engages the idea of scopophilia to purposefully draw attention to horror spectatorship and play with the voyeuristic nature of the viewer."
scopophilia	"When the first paper is due for ""From Ahab to Prufrock,"" he helps her write a paper on the theme of scopophilia in Henry James' ""Daisy Miller."""
scopophilia	"In psychology and psychiatry, scopophilia or scoptophilia ( , ""look to"", ""to examine"" + , ""the tendency towards"") is an aesthetic pleasure drawn from looking at an object or a person."
scopophilia	"In contrast to Freud's interpretation of the ""scopic drive"", other psychoanalytic theories proposed that the practices of scopophilia might lead to madness — either insanity or a mental disorder — which is the scopophilic person's retreat from the concrete world of reality into an abstract world of fantasy."
scopophilia	The theoretic bases of scopophilia were developed by the psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel, in special reference to the process and stages of psychological identification.
scopophilia	That the impersonal interaction of scopophilia (between the looker and the looked-at) sometimes replaced personal interactions in the psychological life of a person who is socially anxious, and seeks to avoid feelings of guilt.
scopophilia	"Lacan's conceptual development of ""the gaze"" linked the pleasure of scopophilia to the person's apprehension of the Other (person) who is not the Self; that is: ""The gaze is this object lost, and suddenly re-found, in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the Other."""
scopophilia	"The practice of scopophilia is how a person's ""desire"" is captured by the imaginary representation of the Other."
scopophilia	Theories alternative to Lacan's interpretations of scopophilia and the gaze proposed that a child's discovery of genital difference, and the accompanying anxiety about not knowing the difference of the Other sex, is the experience that subsequently impels the child's scopic drive to fulfil the desire to look and to look at.
scopophilia	Critical race theorists, such as bell hooks, Shannon Winnubst, and David Marriott present and describe scopophilia and the scopic drive as the psychological and social mechanisms that realize the practices of Other-ing a person to exclude them from society (see also scopophobia).
scopophilia	"The social practice of scopophilia is supposed to fix the appearance and identity of the Other (person), who is not the Self, by way of the gaze that objectifies and dehumanizes them as ""not I"" and thus ""not one of us""."
scopophilia	"In that vein, the practices of cultural scopophilia restrict the number and type of visible representations of ""outsiders"" in a society."
scopophilia	In the 1970s, parting from Lacan's propositions, psychoanalysts of the cinema used the term scopophilia to identify and to describe the aesthetic and emotional pleasures (often pathological), and other unconscious mental processes that occur in the minds spectators gazing at a film.
scopophilia	"Subsequent scholars have challenged Mulvey's influential reading of scopophilia as a ""gross reduction of the erotic and the aesthetic to the politics of representation."""
scopophilia	"A feminist experimental film, ""Riddles of the Sphinx"" was partly inspired by Mulvey's work on feminist film theory of scopophilia and the male gaze, particularly her influential 1975 essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema""."
scopophilia	In her writing on feminist film theory, Mulvey has argued that, if the dominant cinema produces pleasure through scopophilia which favours the male gaze and festishization of woman as object, then alternative versions of cinema need to construct different forms of pleasure based on psychic relations that adopt a feminist perspective.
scopophilia	Sexual in origin, the concept of scopophilia has voyeuristic, exhibitionistic and narcissistic overtones and it is what keeps the male audience’s attention on the screen.
scopophilia	Furthermore, Mulvey explores the concept of scopophilia in relation to two axes: one of activity and one of passivity.
scopophilia	"In Laura Mulvey's essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,"" she identifies what she sees as voyeurism and scopophilia in Hitchcock's movies, with ""Rear Window"" used as an example of how she sees cinema as incorporating the patriarchy into the way that pleasure is constructed and signaled to the audience."
scopophilia	"Other key influences come from Metz's essay ""The Imaginary Signifier"", ""Identification, Mirror,"" where he argues that viewing film is only possible through scopophilia (pleasure from looking, related to voyeurism), which is best exemplified in silent film."
scopophilia	Laura Mulvey added a theory of scopophilia and masculine and feminine subjectivity/objectivity.
scopophilia	"Laura Mulvey's germinal essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"" (written in 1973 and published in 1975) expands on this conception of the passive role of women in cinema to argue that film provides visual pleasure through scopophilia and identification with the on-screen male actor."

Dasein	Blood and soil are certainly powerful and necessary, but they are not a sufficient condition for the Dasein of a people.
Dasein	"Heidegger's account of Dasein passes through an analysis of ""Angst,"" ""the Nothing"" and mortality, and of the structure of ""Care"" as such."
Dasein	"Moreover, Dasein is ""the being that will give access to the question of the meaning of Being,"" according to Heidegger."
Dasein	"This access via Dasein is also that ""in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something."""
Dasein	"In a significant contrast with ""Being and Time"" eight years earlier, Heidegger's ""Introduction to Metaphysics"" ""no longer places the inquiry into the Being of Dasein at the center of his work,"" Instead, the author ""looks to language as the site of a meaning of Being"" (Brian Bard, 1993 essay, ""Heidegger's Reading of Heraclitus"")."
Dasein	"Pappenheim's philosophical treatises include ""Beiträge zur Berichtigung der Beweise vom Dasein Gottes aus der Reinen Vernunft"" (1794) and ""Abermaliger Versuch über den Ontologischen Beweis vom Dasein Gottes"" (1800)."
Dasein	With this in mind, Dasein cautiously enters the town and quickly learns of 'Jaspers', an additive in the food and drink commonly ingested in Santaroga that seems to imbue the consumer with greater health and an expanded mind.
Dasein	Soon, Dasein is having narrow misses with perfectly plausible accidents: a clerk adjusting valves in the kitchen floods Dasein's hotel room with gas; Dasein trips on some loose carpeting, stumbles, falls through a stairwell railing and would have plunged three floors but was caught and saved by a Santarogan (although the incident with the carpeting and fall through the stairwell railing appeared to be a fluke accident, Dasein later realizes it could have been part of a carefully laid trap); a boy playing with a bow and arrow releases it, grazing Dasein's neck; the lift under his car in a garage collapses; a waitress in a diner accidentally uses insecticide rather than sugar for his coffee.
Dasein	Knowing that Jaspers creates exceptionally perceptive, penetrating individual minds, Dasein realizes that he has offended a communal id that feels threatened by him.

Dasein	Soll versuchen, in der Erkenntnis, dass das Dasein aus lauter brutalen, hundsgemeinen Scherzen besteht, Erhebung zu finden.
Dasein	Influenced by Heidegger's insights into the manner in which Dasein stands before earthly death, Kojève sees man as a fundamentally negative creature, who negates existence through labor.
Dasein	Goldmann tries to bring together the Marxist concept of reification from György Lukács and the existential concept of Dasein from Martin Heidegger.
Dasein	Lukács's critique of the alienation inherent in capitalism, is thus present in Dasein as an ontological concept.
Dasein	"Following Heidegger, he cogently asserts that language and human understanding belong together: “Human Dasein resides within language: ‘Language is the house of Being.’” Wierciński’s captivating explication of the relationship between language and understanding comes to its climax in a superb gloss on Gadamer’s revalidation of Augustine’s ""verbum interius""."
Dasein	Heidegger used the concept of Dasein to discuss Nazi ideology, and to advocate support for Hitler.
Dasein	Blood and soil are certainly powerful and necessary, but they are not a sufficient condition for the Dasein of a people.
Dasein	Heidegger invoked the notion of Dasein in supporting the German election of November 1933, in which the electorate was presented with a single Nazi-approved list of candidates:
Dasein	"According to Julian Wolfreys, ""There is no direct 'face'-to'face' relation for Heidegger; despite his invaluable critique of ontology, he still reduces the relation between Dasein and Dasein as mediated by the question and problematic of being."""
Dasein	"Heidegger believes that Dasein already has a ""pre-ontological"" and concrete understanding that shapes how it lives."
Dasein	Heidegger explicitly disagrees with Descartes, and uses an analysis of Dasein to approach the question of the meaning of being.
Dasein	"""Famously, Heidegger writes of Dasein as Being-in-the-world,"" according to Michael Wheeler (2011)."
Dasein	"Heidegger's account of Dasein in ""Being and Time"" passes through a dissection of the experiences of ""Angst"", ""the Nothing"" and mortality, and then through an analysis of the structure of ""Care"" as such."
Dasein	"Moreover, he wrote that Dasein is ""the being that will give access to the question of the meaning of Being""."
Dasein	"This access via Dasein is also that ""in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something."""
Dasein	In this account, Heidegger holds that no particular understanding of Being (nor state of Dasein and its endeavors) is to be preferred over another.
Dasein	"On the one hand, Dasein is ""stretched along"" between birth and death, and thrown into its world; into its ""possibilities"" which ""Dasein"" is charged with assuming."
Dasein	"The 1935 ""Introduction to Metaphysics"" ""clearly shows the shift"" to an emphasis on language from a previous emphasis on Dasein in ""Being and Time"" eight years earlier, according to Brian Bard's 1993 essay titled ""Heidegger's Reading of Heraclitus""."
Dasein	"But the basic tenet of ""existentialism"" has nothing at all in common with the statement from ""Being and Time"" [that ""the 'essence' of Dasein lies in its existence""]—apart from the fact that in ""Being and Time"" no statement about the relation of ""essentia"" and ""existentia"" can yet be expressed, since there it is still a question of preparing something precursory."
Dasein	"According to Derrida, Sartre's interpretation of Dasein and other key Heideggerian concerns is overly psychologistic, anthropocentric, and misses the historicality central to ""Dasein"" in ""Being and Time""."
Dasein	"Mendelssohn then published his ""Morgenstunden oder Vorlesungen über das Dasein Gottes"" (""Morning hours or lectures about God's existence""), seemingly a series of lectures to his oldest son, his son-in-law and a young friend, usually held ""in the morning hours"", in which he explained his personal philosophical world-view, his own understanding of Spinoza and Lessing's ""purified"" (""geläutert"") pantheism."
Dasein	He is known as the vocalist of bands Dasein and R*A*P, and became the full-time vocalist of Rider Chips in 2005.
Dasein	"As he wrote in 1925 in ""History of the Concept of Time"":&lt;templatestyles src=""Template:Blockquote/styles.css"" /&gt;This certainty, that ""I myself am in that I will die,"" is the basic certainty of Dasein itself."
Dasein	"If such pointed formulations mean anything at all, then the appropriate statement pertaining to Dasein in its being would have to be ""sum moribundus"" [I am in dying], ""moribundus"" not as someone gravely ill or wounded, but insofar as I am, I am ""moribundus""."
Dasein	In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification.
Dasein	"His works include: ""Von dem Dasein Gottes, die Selbstredende Vernunft,"" Ratisbon, 1775; ""Anmerkungen über die Erste Geschichte der Menschheit nach dem Zeugnisse Mosis,"" Nuremberg, 1782; ""Vereinigung der Mosaischen Gesetze mit dem Talmud,"" Ratisbon, 1786; ""Einheitsgedichte,"" a German translation of the ""Shir ha-Yiḥud,"" Ratisbon, 1788; ""Abhandlung von der Freiheit des Menschen,"" and ""Kleine Schriften,"" Ratisbon, 1789."
Dasein	"Hertzberg also translated into Hebrew Moses Mendelssohn's ""Morgenstunden, oder Vorlesungen über das Dasein Gottes"", Immanuel Kant's ""Critique of Pure Reason"", Salomon Munk's ""Palestine"", and some volumes of Heinrich Graetz's ""Geschichte der Juden""."
Dasein	Some of Martin Heidegger's philosophical terms, such as Ab-grund (void), Das Nichts (the Nothing) and Dasein have been considered in light of Buddhist terms which express similar ideas such as Emptiness.
Dasein	"Da brach der Tod in seiner schleußlichen Gestalt das Schöne, jugendliche Dasein mitten in vollster Blüte."""

Dasein	"In ""Der Kampf ums Dasein am Himmel"", Du Prel endeavoured to apply the Darwinian doctrine of biological evolution not only to the sphere of consciousness but also even more widely as the philosophical principle of the world."
Dasein	"There, he wrote ""Der ontologische Beweis für das Dasein des Absoluten"" (""The Ontological Proof for the Existence of the Absolute"") in 1897, and successfully defended his thesis ""Der Satz vom Grunde"" (""The Principle of Reason"") in 1898."
Dasein	"In fact, the essence of Dasein directly evokes the question of Being, and likewise ""what is primarily interrogated in the question of the meaning of being is that being which has the character of Da-sein.”."
Dasein	"This means that, for any particular being or area of study, ""the ontological analysis of this being always requires a previous glimpse of existentiality.” Nevertheless, Dasein can relate to it in an ontic-existentiell or in an ontological-existential manner."
Dasein	The above understanding is limited to Dasein alone due to its qualitative distinction from other beings.
Dasein	Und wäre es fast nur durch ihr Dasein und stummes Beispiel auf diejenigen, die neben ihnen und mit ihnen untermischt wohnen.

Dasein	The philosophy of daseinsanalysis is centered on the thought that the human Dasein (Human existence) is open to any and all experience, and that the phenomenological world is experienced freely in an undistorted way.
Dasein	In Daseinsanalytical thinking, there are thousands of modes of being that make up each human Dasein (existence), but only one overarching fundamental nature of that Dasein.
Dasein	The human Dasein is open to all experience, where the body can only experience one thing at a time.
Dasein	In Daseinsanalysis, the dream state of an individual is thought of as a continuation of our waking state and needs to be considered real because the human Dasein is expressing what is 'shining forth' inside it.
Dasein	He has participated in the following festivals also: Dasein in Athens, Greece (2010), Sha’ar International Poetry Festival, Tel Aviv, Israel, (2010), The National Festival for Poetic Books, Bucharest, Romania (2011), The Belgrade Festival of Poetry and Books, Belgrade, Serbia (2011), Mediterranean Voices Festival, Lodève, France (2011), Prague Book Fair (2012) among others.

Dasein	In his effort to redefine man, Heidegger introduces a statement: 'the ownmost of Dasein consists in its existence'.
Dasein	"""World"" can be understood in another ontical sense—not, however, as those entities which Dasein essentially is not and which can be encountered within-the-world, but rather as the ""wherein"" a factical Dasein as such can be said to 'live'."
three-point lighting	The terminology comes from the higher balance in the ratio between the key light and the fill light in a traditional three-point lighting setup.

longshore current	When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along parallel to the coastline.
longshore current	In places of reentrance along a coastline (such as inlets, coves, rias, and bays), sediments carried by a longshore current will fall out where the current dissipates, forming a spit.
longshore current	"Where the direction of the shore inland ""re-enters"", or changes direction, for example at a headland, the longshore current spreads out or dissipates."
longshore current	Longshore drift from longshore current is a geological process that consists of the transportation of sediments (clay, silt, pebbles, sand, shingle) along a coast parallel to the shoreline, which is dependent on the angle of incoming wave direction.
longshore current	Higher energy waves breaking in quick succession tend to mobilise sediment from the shallows, keeping it in suspension where it is prone to be carried along the beach by longshore currents, or carried out to sea to form longshore bars, especially if the longshore current meets an outflow from a river or flooding stream.
longshore current	This is often required where the flow of new sediment caused by the longshore current has been disrupted by construction of harbors, breakwaters, causeways or boat ramps, creating new current flows that scour the sand from behind these structures and deprive the beach of restorative sediments.
longshore current	The deposits show sedimentary structures indicating a longshore current to the north.

bomb	The basic problem in bombing is the calculation of the trajectory of the bomb after it leaves the aircraft.
bomb	Due to the effects of air drag, wind and gravity, bombs follow a complex path that changes over time – the path of a bomb dropped from 100 meters looks different from the one when the same bomb is dropped from 5,000 meters.
bomb	"The path was too complex for early systems to calculate directly, and was instead measured experimentally at a bombing range by measuring the distance the bomb travelled forward during its fall, a value known as the ""range""."
bomb	During the approach to the target, the bomb aimer sets their sights to that angle and then drops the bombs when the target passes through the crosshairs.
bomb	"To use such a ""vector bombsight"", the bomb aimer first requires an accurate measurement of the speed and direction of the wind."
bomb	The accuracy of such systems was limited by the time taken to measure the wind in advance of the bomb run, and the care taken to calculate the results.
bomb	Even without such problems, a long bomb run was needed to ensure the aircraft was approaching along the correct line as indicated by the sights, often several miles long.
bomb	To measure this, the bomb aimer first dials in estimates of the wind speed and direction, which causes the computer to begin moving the bombsights to stay pointed at the target as the bomber moved toward it.
bomb	On 22 December 1939, at a pre-arranged meeting on bombsight policy, Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt stated flatly that the CSBS did not meet RAF requirements and asked for a bombsight that would allow the bomber to take any sort of evasive action throughout the bomb run.
bomb	This, in effect, demanded the use of stabilization in order to allow the bomb aimer to continue making adjustments while the bomber manoeuvred.
bomb	In general use, the bomb aimer simply dialled in estimates for the wind direction and speed, set a dial to select the type of bomb being used, and everything from that point on was entirely automated.

checkdown	On Alabama's next possession QB Jacob Coker passed the ball in a checkdown screen to OJ Howard who, getting good blocking, ran for 63 yards.
checkdown	In American football, a checkdown pass is when the quarterback attempts to complete a short, accurate pass, typically to a running back or tight end, as a last option when the primary option(s) as designed by the play call are covered.
checkdown	Because the quarterback does not look for the checkdown pass until after they have scanned for open receivers down the field for about 3–4 seconds, the defensive line has had time to enter the backfield and so a checkdown pass is often thrown in the face of pressure from the defensive line.
checkdown	Alternatively, if the quarterback is inexperienced or the defensive team has sent a blitz, with linebackers and/or defensive backs also looking to sack the quarterback, the checkdown may also turn out to be the quarterback's second or even first look.
checkdown	A screen pass and a checkdown are different, because a screen pass is designed primarily to go to the short route after drawing in pass rushers.
checkdown	The non-blitzing safety, usually the free safety, has an enormous amount of field to protect and is at a serious disadvantage if the blitz is unsuccessful and receivers threaten his coverage area or if the offense can quickly move the ball forward through immediate checkdown passes or draw plays.

paywall	Proponents of the paywall believe that it may be crucial for smaller publications to stay afloat.
paywall	Many paywall advocates also contend that people are more than willing to pay a small price for quality content.
paywall	According to the study by Felix Simon and Lucas Graves, more than two-thirds of leading newspapers (69%) across the EU and US were operating some kind of online paywall as of 2019, a trend that has increased since 2017 according to the researchers, with the US seeing an increase from 60% to 76%.
paywall	Erecting a paywall restricts the public's open communication with one another by restricting the ability to both read and share online news.

defragment	There are no programs to specifically defragment a ReiserFS file system, although tools have been written to automatically copy the contents of fragmented files hoping that more contiguous blocks of free space can be found.
defragment	Although the extent-based nature of XFS and the delayed allocation strategy it uses significantly improves the file system's resistance to fragmentation problems, XFS provides a filesystem defragmentation utility (codice_9, short for XFS filesystem reorganizer) that can defragment the files on a mounted and active XFS filesystem.
defragment	There is no need to defragment the hard-drive or clean up the registry every month, as all housekeeping is done by the operating system itself.
defragment	The ability to choose individual drives to defragment is being reintroduced as well.
defragment	"These long walks to and from the studio was ""no better way to defragment your mind than to let it wander off in the air, up in the treetops and gliding along the waves,"" according to Blankenship."
defragment	Auslogics Disk Defrag is a freemium software application for Microsoft Windows intended to defragment files and folders on a hard drive, consolidate free space and optimize file placement using different criteria.
defragment	Starting with file defragmentation in its earlier versions, Auslogics Disk Defrag expanded its capabilities to include free space defragmentation, optimization of file placement based on various criteria, ability to schedule defragmentation, defragment in the background, as well as a number of advanced functions in the professional version of the program.

rootkit	Rootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the software that is intended to find it.
rootkit	Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem.

rootkit	A small number of rootkits may be considered utility applications by their users: for example, a rootkit might cloak a CD-ROM-emulation driver, allowing video game users to defeat anti-piracy measures that require insertion of the original installation media into a physical optical drive to verify that the software was legitimately purchased.
rootkit	"&lt;templatestyles src=""Template:Blockquote/styles.css"" /&gt;...since user mode applications all run in their own memory space, the rootkit needs to perform this patching in the memory space of every running application."
rootkit	In addition, the rootkit needs to monitor the system for any new applications that execute and patch those programs' memory space before they fully execute.
rootkit	This class of rootkit has unrestricted security access, but is more difficult to write.
rootkit	"A rootkit can modify data structures in the Windows kernel using a method known as ""direct kernel object manipulation"" (DKOM)."
rootkit	A kernel mode rootkit can also hook the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT), or modify the gates between user mode and kernel mode, in order to cloak itself.
rootkit	"Similarly for the Linux operating system, a rootkit can modify the ""system call table"" to subvert kernel functionality."
rootkit	It is common that a rootkit creates a hidden, encrypted filesystem in which it can hide other malware or original copies of files it has infected.

rootkit	By exploiting hardware virtualization features such as Intel VT or AMD-V, this type of rootkit runs in Ring -1 and hosts the target operating system as a virtual machine, thereby enabling the rootkit to intercept hardware calls made by the original operating system.
rootkit	A hypervisor rootkit does not have to make any modifications to the kernel of the target to subvert it; however, that does not mean that it cannot be detected by the guest operating system.
rootkit	"The ""SubVirt"" laboratory rootkit, developed jointly by Microsoft and University of Michigan researchers, is an academic example of a virtual-machine–based rootkit (VMBR),"
rootkit	A firmware rootkit uses device or platform firmware to create a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS.
rootkit	The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity.
rootkit	In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation.
rootkit	Rootkits employ a variety of techniques to gain control of a system; the type of rootkit influences the choice of attack vector.
rootkit	Another approach is to use a Trojan horse, deceiving a computer user into trusting the rootkit's installation program as benign—in this case, social engineering convinces a user that the rootkit is beneficial.
rootkit	The installation task is made easier if the principle of least privilege is not applied, since the rootkit then does not have to explicitly request elevated (administrator-level) privileges.
rootkit	Some malicious rootkit installations are commercially driven, with a pay-per-install (PPI) compensation method typical for distribution.
rootkit	Once installed, a rootkit takes active measures to obscure its presence within the host system through subversion or evasion of standard operating system security tools and application programming interface (APIs) used for diagnosis, scanning, and monitoring.
rootkit	It is not uncommon for a rootkit to disable the event logging capacity of an operating system, in an attempt to hide evidence of an attack.
rootkit	The fundamental problem with rootkit detection is that if the operating system has been subverted, particularly by a kernel-level rootkit, it cannot be trusted to find unauthorized modifications to itself or its components.
rootkit	In other words, rootkit detectors that work while running on infected systems are only effective against rootkits that have some defect in their camouflage, or that run with lower user-mode privileges than the detection software in the kernel.
rootkit	Any rootkit detectors that prove effective ultimately contribute to their own ineffectiveness, as malware authors adapt and test their code to escape detection by well-used tools.
rootkit	Detection by examining storage while the suspect operating system is not operational can miss rootkits not recognised by the checking software, as the rootkit is not active and suspicious behavior is suppressed; conventional anti-malware software running with the rootkit operational may fail if the rootkit hides itself effectively.
rootkit	The best and most reliable method for operating-system-level rootkit detection is to shut down the computer suspected of infection, and then to check its storage by booting from an alternative trusted medium (e.g.
rootkit	The technique is effective because a rootkit cannot actively hide its presence if it is not running.
rootkit	The behavioral-based approach to detecting rootkits attempts to infer the presence of a rootkit by looking for rootkit-like behavior.
rootkit	Defective rootkits can sometimes introduce very obvious changes to a system: the Alureon rootkit crashed Windows systems after a security update exposed a design flaw in its code.
overclock	Notably, overclockers found that Radeon 8500 and Radeon 9000 could not reliably overclock to 300 MHz without additional voltage, so undoubtedly R250 would have had similar issues because of its greater complexity and equivalent manufacturing technology, and this would have resulted in poor chip yields, and thus, higher costs.
overclock	CPU shims are not common at all in OEM computers, but are used by some computer hardware enthusiasts who may use heavier heatsinks because they wish to have a cooler or less noisy system or perhaps to overclock the CPU for better performance.
overclock	Some users chose to overclock their Pentium Pro chips, with the 200 MHz version often being run at 233 MHz, the 180 MHz version often being run at 200 MHz, and the 150 MHz version often being run at 166 MHz.
overclock	However, the 5x86 is not known to overclock well; 120 MHz is generally considered to be pushing the limitations of the process on which it was fabricated.

overclock	Also, the OCC can be programmed to overclock the POWER8 processor, or to lower its power consumption by reducing the operating frequency (which is similar to the configurable TDP found in some of the Intel and AMD processors).
overclock	While the Intel 855GME chipset supports all Pentium M CPU's, the Intel 855GM chipset does not officially support 90 nm 2MB L2 cache (Dothan core) models (even though it works, it only works at 400FSB, some 3rd party/user was able to overclock the FSB on 855GM/GME/PM to support 533FSB Dothan Core).

overclock	The added power draw needed to overclock either processing units often requires additional cooling, usually by air cooling or water cooling.
overclock	If the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed, an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering.
overclock	Others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line, and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model's stock performance.
overclock	The end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available CPU multipliers, bus dividers, voltages; the user's ability to manage thermal loads, cooling techniques; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances, interaction with other components and the rest of the system.
overclock	Increasing front-side bus or northbridge/PCI clocks can overclock locked CPUs, but this throws many system frequencies out of sync, since the RAM and PCI frequencies are modified as well.
overclock	Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor, such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device's processor.
overclock	However, because the only 2 add-in partners producing this card (BFG and EVGA) decided to overclock it, this version of the 8800 GTS actually ran slightly faster than a stock GTX in most scenarios, especially at higher resolutions, due to the increased clock speeds.
overclock	Overclockers have been able to overclock the core to 4.26 GHz using air cooling simply by raising the unlocked CPU multiplier.
overclock	When a single threaded application is running, the CPU can turn off one of its cores and overclock the active core.
overclock	Desktop computers also provide more space for cooling fans and vents to dissipate heat, allowing enthusiasts to overclock with less risk.
overclock	One solution would be to overclock the conversion elements, introduce a digital filter and follow them with an acoustical low pass filter.
overclock	With CPUs being multiplier locked, the only way to overclock is to increase the BClk, which can be raised by only 5–7% without other hardware components failing.
overclock	Non-K edition CPUs can overclock up to four bins from its turbo multiplier.
overclock	The basic idea to overclock part of the frame and to oversize the payload dates back to 1999.

overclock	CommanderPi is a system monitoring and configuration tool designed to check system information and overclock the CPU.
overclock	Notably, overclockers found that Radeon 8500 and Radeon 9000 could not reliably overclock to 300 MHz without additional voltage, so undoubtedly R250 would have had similar issues because of its greater complexity and equivalent manufacturing technology, and this would have resulted in poor chip yields, and thus, higher costs.
overclock	Enthusiasts who understand how to overclock sometimes do so to prolong the usefulness of their hardware.
overclock	"""Professional"" overclockers commonly overclock only one core of processors, typically older AMD CPUs, to obtain CPU speeds well beyond the ability of the official configuration."
overclock	When not all cores are needed, the processor will automatically overclock up to half of the cores by up to 500 MHz, leaving the other half idle.

fiqh	He believed traditional scholars were unable to distinguish the fundamentals of Islam from the details of its application, built up in elaborate structures of medieval legal schools of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence).
fiqh	He was the authority of the fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) of the Hanafi madhhab (school of law).
fiqh	This is still considered the authoritative text of Hanafi fiqh today.

fiqh	"Some of the most basic and important features of the sunnah – worship rituals like ""salat"" (ritual prayer), ""zakat"" (ritual tithing), ""hajj"" (pilgrimage to Mecca), ""sawm"" (dawn to dusk fasting during Ramadan) – are known to Muslim from being passed down 'from the many to the many' (according to scholars of fiqh such as Al-Shafi'i), bypassing books of hadith, (which were more often consulted for answers to details not agreed upon or not frequently practiced) and issues of authenticity."

fiqh	"The 4th/10th and 5th/11th centuries were no kinder, for while the Shafi'is [school of fiqh law] championed the Sahihayn, Malikis were initially enamored of their own texts and 'tangential to the Sahihayn network"" (37), while the Hanbalis were openly critical."

fiqh	"Other issues of disagreement include whether the Quran, the central religious text of Islam, can be abrogated by the Sunnah, the body of traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community, or vice versa — a disagreement in Sunni Islam between the Shafiʽi and Hanafi schools of fiqh ""jurisprudence""; and whether verses of the Quran may be abrogated at all, instead of reinterpreted and more narrowly defined — an approach favored by a minority of scholars."
fiqh	This became especially important, (as mentioned above), after the principle of fiqh was established that in forming Islamic law, hadith attributed to Muhammad overruled those attributed to all other early Muslims on the same issue.
fiqh	"John Burton argues that naskh was first employed by Islamic scholars (""usulis"") in the second century of Islam working to develop principles (""usul al-fiqh"") for the Islamic law (fiqh) and seeking to explain why some fiqh rulings were not founded on Quranic/Sunnah revelation."
fiqh	By this time the Islamic empire spanned three continents and fiqh had been established in the different regions but usulis found rulings in certain verses of the Quran and parts of the Sunnah had been ignored in their formulation.
fiqh	Burton argues that protecting established fiqh rulings from the contradiction of Quranic verses such as Q.2:240 (and not addressing conflicts between different lines of revelation) was what motivated the usulis who developed the theory of naskh.
fiqh	"In the first case, a punishment of stoning to death (lapidation) for adultery is found in the Islamic law of the founders of all four surviving schools of Sunni fiqh (""madhab"") and by the majority of scholars of fiqh, but the penalty prescribed for adultery in the ""mus'haf"" is flogging (in Q.24:2)."
fiqh	"However, evidence for the existence of this verse has been criticized as weak, the hadith unreliable, and followers of Maliki and Hanafi fiqh believe evidence for stoning being the proper Islamic punishment comes not from an alleged Quranic verse but from reports of Muhammad calling for execution of adulterers by stoning found in collections of sound (""sahih"") hadith — meaning that the hadith on stoning abrogate the flogging verse in the Quran."
fiqh	In contrast, the Hanafi fiqh of Sunni Islam, from the days of Abu Hanifa, along with his disciples such as Abu Yusuf, believe that Sunnah can abrogate a Quranic verse.
fiqh	As mentioned above this was stoning death (something widely supported by the Sunni schools of fiqh including the school of Al-Shafi'i, but this punishment was found only in the Sunnah; in the Quran, verse Q.24:2 clearly called for 100 strokes of the lash — not execution — as a penalty for adultery.
fiqh	"John Burton argues that the theory of naskh was an ""invention of fiqh scholars"", used not to develop fiqh but to validated already existing fiqh doctrine."
fiqh	"(Burton is among those in the ""mainstream"" of the Islamic studies field of fiqh/Islamic law led by Ignác Goldziher and Joseph Schacht who hold that fiqh doctrine did not grow directly and organically from the Quran and sayings and doings of Muhammad but was already established and sometimes in contradiction with the Quran when the theory of naskh was established.)"
fiqh	"A ""careful examination of the Quran itself produces no evidence that naskh of the sort fiqh scholars had in mind is envisioned in or exemplified by the Quran."""
fiqh	"Furthermore, Burton argues (according to Bernard Weiss) that rather than fiqh scholars deciding which of two (or more) conflicting verses should be the basis of a ruling in Islamic law by determining which verse came later, the scholars searched for ""text that supported"" an already established doctrine of Islamic law and then postulating ""a chronology"" whereby that supportive text came ""later and the non-supportive text earlier""."
fiqh	Although Barelvis may follow any one of the Ashari and Maturidi schools of Islamic theology and one of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali madhhabs of fiqh in addition to optionally choosing from one of the Sunni Sufi orders or tariqas, most Barelvis in South Asia follow the Maturidi school of Islamic theology, the Hanafi madhhab of fiqh and the Qadiri or Chishti Sufi orders.

fiqh	Al-Khatib had a number of teachers but his two main teachers whom he studied both hadith and fiqh by two leading experts named Abu Nu'aym al-Isfahani (one of the best hadith authorities at his time) and Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi (leading fuqaha' at his time).
fiqh	According to modern fiqh researchers the aftermath of Khaibar battle were significant as various Islamic jurist scholars from various school of thoughs such as Dawud al-Zahiri, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Malik ibn Anas, and Muhammad Shaybani were basing the event of the ruling of seizure of Khaibar properties by Muslim conquerors and employing the subdued Jewish inhabitants as the worker of Khaibar gardens and plantations in the aftermath of the battle.

keriah	There exist testimony of ikuv keriah occurring in the year 5665 (1904-1905) in the Hurva synagogue, by women who prevented the reading from commencing.
keriah	"A baal keriah (Hebrew: &lt;templatestyles src=""Script/styles_hebrew.css"" /&gt;בַּעַל קְרִיאָה‎, 'master of the reading'), colloquially called the baal korei (Hebrew: &lt;templatestyles src=""Script/styles_hebrew.css"" /&gt;בַּעַל קוֹרֵא‎, 'master-reader'), is a member of a Jewish congregation who reads from the Sefer Torah during the service."
keriah	As there are no niqqud, punctuation, or cantillation marks (called in Yiddish) in a Sefer Torah, and these are required features of the reading, the baal keriah must memorize them beforehand.
keriah	When the Torah scroll is placed on the bimah, or reading table, the baal keriah approaches the bimah by the most direct route possible and stands in front of the scroll, a little to the left.
keriah	A gabbai uncovers the scroll and the baal keriah indicates to the oleh which section will be read.
keriah	"The congregation answers ""amen,"" the scroll is unrolled again, and then the baal keriah chants the section, holding onto the left roller and pointing, usually with a specially-made ornate pointer called a yad in his right."
keriah	During the chanting, the oleh reads quietly along with the baal keriah from the scroll, if he is able to.
keriah	Each of the gabba'im will also read along with the baal keriah, but from Chumashim, in order to let the baal keriah know of any errors.
keriah	The baal keriah remains standing in place at the bimah until all the readings from the scroll are complete.
keriah	On the Sabbath and holidays, the baal keriah will recite the half kaddish at the bimah after the penultimate reading.
keriah	The baal keriah then joins the rest of the congregation in listening and reading the haftorah quietly along with the maftir.
keriah	The baal keriah will repeat this phrase after the congregation, and the oleh will recite the blessings after the reading as normal.
keriah	If the baal keriah is himself called up as the oleh, he stands alone in front of the scroll, kisses the section to be read as usual, and recites the preparatory blessings like other olim.
keriah	As he chants from the scroll, he either holds both of the rollers without pointing, or a gabbai holds a roller so that the baal keriah can use the pointer to keep his place.
keriah	Also as with the Torah scroll, the baal keriah reads while standing, although the congregation may sit.
keriah	At the beginning of each chapter, the baal keriah raises his voice.
keriah	If there is no professional baal keriah available, and there is a minyan, one of the other congregants should prepare the reading in advance to allow the Torah to be read with its proper vowels, punctuation and .
keriah	To practice for the Torah reading, a baal keriah will usually use a special book called a Tikkun.

delict	In both legal systems, when applied in English speaking countries, the term delict is used to refer to tortious liability (unlike, for instance, in Spain where the cognate of the term delict refers to a criminal offence).
delict	In South Africa and neighbouring countries, the Roman-Dutch law of delict is in force, having been preserved after the United Kingdom annexed Dutch settlements in South Africa and spread as neighbouring British colonies adopted South African law via reception statutes.
delict	"By way of a legal fiction, 'personal injury' is treated as (physical) 'damage done', with the net effect that 'the ""actio injuriarum"" root of Scots law infuses the [nominate] delict assault as much as any development of the ""lex Aquilia""' and wrongdoing that results in physical harm to a person may give rise to both an aquilian action and an actio iniuriarum."
delict	"Some jurisdictions have a separate tort or delict of injury, intentional infliction of emotional distress, involving the making of a statement, even if truthful, intended to harm the claimant out of malice; some have a separate tort or delict of ""invasion of privacy"" in which the making of a true statement may give rise to liability: but neither of these comes under the general heading of ""defamation""."
delict	"There is also, in almost all jurisdictions, a tort or delict of ""misrepresentation"", involving the making of a statement that is untrue even though not defamatory."
delict	"For liability under the ""actio iniuriarum"", the general elements of delict must be present, but specific rules have been developed for each element."
delict	"In the letter, ""Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela"" (Safeguarding the Sanctity of the Sacraments), ""§1 Reservation to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) is also extended to a delict against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue committed by a cleric with a minor below the age of eighteen years."

delict	"Canon law states that in certain circumstances ""the accused is not bound by a ""latae sententiae"" penalty""; among the ten circumstances listed are commission of a delict by someone not yet sixteen years old, or by someone who without negligence does not know of the existence of the penalty, or by someone ""who was coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience""."
delict	"Accordingly, the court had held in ""Rail Commuters"" that, when determining whether an action lies in the private law of delict when a public-law duty has been breached, the constitutional norm of accountability should be considered."

delict	"The term is similarly used in a handful of other English speaking jurisdictions which derive their private law from French or Spanish law, such as Louisiana and the Philippines, but ""tort"" is the equivalent legal term used in common law jurisdictions and in general discussions of non-contractual liability (for instance, Wikipedia has an article on European tort law rather than “European law of delict”, since tort is the generally understood term in comparative international law, and a page on Tort Law in China rather than “law of delict in China”)."
delict	"In Italian law, ""delitto penale"" is the same concept, but ""illecito civile extracontrattuale"" (or ""delitto civile""), like delict in Scots law, is an intentional or negligent act which gives rise to a legal obligation between parties even though there has been no contract between them, akin to common-law tort."
delict	In the canon law of the Catholic Church, a delict is a crime.
delict	"In the most narrowly construed sense, delict is a Latin word (""delictum"" ‘offence, wrong’) and a legal term, which, in some civil law systems, signifies a willful wrong, similar to the common law concept of tort though differing in many substantive ways."
delict	The law of delict in civil law countries is usually a general statute passed by the legislature whereas tort law in common law countries arises from case law.
delict	In addition, a delict is defined abstractly in terms of infringement of rights whereas in common law, there are many specific types of torts (English terminology).
delict	In addition to comprising rules pertaining to reparation for loss caused by negligent conduct, discussed above, the Scots law of delict is also concerned with affording remedy in cases which concern non-patrimonial injury, wilful interference with property rights and the commission of nominate delicts (such as, e.g., defamation).

delict	In addition to rescission and restitution, the threatened party may recover damages in delict for any loss caused through entry into the contract.

delict	JC Van der Walt and Rob Midgley define a delict 'in general terms [...] as a civil wrong', and more narrowly as 'wrongful and blameworthy conduct which causes harm to a person'.
delict	The classic remedy for a delict is compensation: a claim of damages for the harm caused.
delict	Roman-Dutch law, based on Roman law, is the strongest influence on South Africa's common law, where delict also falls under the law of obligations.
delict	"In contrast to the casuistic approach of the Roman law of delict, the South African law of delict is based [...] on three pillars: the ""actio legis Aquiliae"", the ""actio iniuriarum"" and the action for pain and suffering."
delict	Although delict may be described as at the bottom a system of loss allocation, it is important to note that not every damage or loss will incur liability at law.
delict	As Christian von Bar puts it, 'The law of delict can only operate as an effective, sensible and fair system of compensation if excessive liability is avoided.
delict	There are, for this reason, in-built mechanisms in the South African law of delict to keep liability within reasonable limits.
delict	Van der Walt and Midgley list the elements of a delict as follows:
delict	Conduct in the law of delict is usually divided into factual and legal causation.
delict	One obvious prerequisite for liability in terms of the law of delict is that the plaintiff must have suffered harm; in terms of the Aquilian action, that harm must be patrimonial, which traditionally meant monetary loss sustained due to physical damage to a person or property.
delict	In respect of a claim in terms of the Aquilian action, there is only one function: to restore the plaintiff's patrimony and, as far as possible, to place him in the position he would have occupied in had the delict not been committed.

delict	K v Minister of Safety and Security is an important case in the South African law of delict and South African constitutional law.
delict	"This test, drawn from the case of ""Minister of Police v Rabie"" had both a subjective stage (evaluating the state of mind of the employee) and an objective stage (considering the link between the delict and the employer's enterprise)."
delict	"This test contained both a factual assessment (the question of the subjective intention of the perpetrators of the delict) and a consideration raising a question of mixed fact and law: that is to say, the objective question of whether or not the delict committed was ""sufficiently connected to the business of the employer"" to render the employer liable."
delict	It was possible, O'Regan J continued, for an employee at the same time to commit a delict for his own purposes, and neglect to perform his duties as an employee.

delict	"The core source of ""obligationes ex delicto"" is a private delict (""delicta privata""); public delicts could not form such obligations."

bullet	If a certain edition featured more than one station that transmitted on the same channel but served different markets, the primary station in the edition was designated by a black bullet with a white number, while the other was indicated by a white bullet with a black number; some editions have also used a split (half for stations broadcasting on frequencies from channel 10 and up; three split with the channel number in the middle) or vertical channel bullet if it covered a large area.
bullet	In cable-specific editions, a bullet indicating a broadcast or cable channel's local cable assignment (except where a broadcast station's cable channel assignment is the same as its over-the-air channel or where smaller cable systems are listed) appeared alongside the specific station or network indicator.
bullet	"Each station was listed in a separate entry corresponding to their city of license, and in some cases, one or more stations serving a particular media market were broken out from competing stations serving the same market based on their primary city of service (for example, in the Oklahoma City/Oklahoma State and North Texas editions, ABC affiliate KSWO-TV in Lawton, Oklahoma – which was designated under a black bullet until the Oklahoma City and Tulsa editions were consolidated into a singular Oklahoma State edition in November 2003, when it began being identified by the outlined bullets assigned to its same-market competitors – was listed as serving ""Lawton/Wichita Falls,"" appearing in a separate entry from the three stations serving the primary city of that station's home market, Wichita Falls, Texas, NBC affiliate KFDX-TV, CBS affiliate KAUZ-TV and independent station-turned-Fox affiliate KJTL)."

bullet	One bullet had entered her back and severed an artery which caused a severe and instant hemorrhage.
bullet	This inevitably reduces the seal of the bullet in the barrel, allowing hot gunpowder gases to reach the sides of the projectile, vaporizing some of the material and depositing it in the bore.
bullet	Cheyenne Tactical claimed a Doppler radar-measured G1 ballistic coefficient (BC) for the Lost River Ballistic Technologies/Jamison International 419-grain (27.15 g) bullet of roughly 0.934 and a stated BC for the 305-grain (19.76 g) bullet of 0.611, though these numbers have been disputed by a number of knowledgeable sources.
bullet	Jamison International states the G1 BC of this bullet on their website currently (2009) at 0.940.

bullet	The BDR is loaded with a 305 grain (19.76 g) bullet (claimed G1 BC = 0.612) and is intended for short and medium range application using the point-blank range aiming method.
bullet	An example of such a special .375 caliber extreme range bullet is the German CNC manufactured mono-metal 26.44 gram (408 gr) .375 Viking (G1 BC 1.537; this Ballistic coefficient (BC) is calculated by its designer, Mr. Lutz Möller, and not proven by Doppler radar measurements).
bullet	This bullet has since exhibited dynamic stability problems and is no longer produced.
bullet	The .375 Viking bullet had an overall length of 70 mm (2.756 in) and derived its anticipated low drag from a radical LD Haack or Sears-Haack profile in the bullet's nose area.
chargeback	The phrase chargeback insurance is also sometimes used to describe the guarantee provided by online fraud prevention companies such as Vesta, ClearSale, Forter, Riskified and Signifyd.
chargeback	For this reason, online fraud prevention companies who offer decisions (meaning, they provide an approve or decline decision for orders) rather than scores (where the merchant must themselves decide whether to approve or decline) sometimes offer to cover the cost of the chargeback, since the chargeback would not have occurred had their decision not been incorrect.
chargeback	This form of chargeback insurance, more properly called a chargeback guarantee, will typically cover all losses of the relevant type, not only through one gateway or processor.
chargeback	A merchant claiming under a chargeback insurance policy may be reimbursed for:
chargeback	A typical chargeback insurance policy will only cover losses on credit card transactions purchased through its own specific payment processor or payment gateway.
chargeback	While chargeback insurance can help cover losses, like any insurance there are pros and cons.
chargeback	While some fraud protection services charge a flat-rate fee per transaction (typically 0.5 to 15 cents per transaction), vendors who offer chargeback insurance usually charge a percentage-based fee of 0.5% to 1.5% which can be cost-prohibitive for higher-dollar transactions.
chargeback	The following year, First National Merchant Solutions introduced First Resolution OnlineTM, the first chargeback management tool in the market to allow merchants to resolve chargebacks online.
chargeback	A chargeback is a return of money to a payer of a transaction, especially a credit card transaction.
chargeback	The chargeback reverses a money transfer from the consumer's bank account, line of credit, or credit card.
chargeback	The chargeback is ordered by the bank that issued the consumer's payment card.
chargeback	In the distribution industry, a chargeback occurs when the supplier sells a product at a higher price to the distributor than the price they have set with the end user.
chargeback	The distributor submits a chargeback to the supplier so they can recover the money lost in the transaction.
chargeback	A consumer may initiate a chargeback by contacting their issuing bank and filing a substantiated complaint regarding one or more debit items on their statement.
chargeback	Card association chargeback rules are available online for public inspection and review.
chargeback	"This may occur where the card issuer generates a second (or ""arbitration"") chargeback against the merchant, after receiving the merchant's response to the initial chargeback."
chargeback	The second chargeback results in a second crediting of the cardholder's account for the disputed funds, after having been credited back to the merchant with its response to the initial chargeback.
chargeback	The merchant's only recourse after the second chargeback is to initiate arbitration of the dispute by the card association.
chargeback	With each chargeback the issuer selects and submits a numeric reason code.
chargeback	One of the most common reasons for a chargeback is a fraudulent transaction.
chargeback	In cases of card not present transactions the merchant is usually responsible for the chargeback and associated fees.
chargeback	For transactions where the original invoice was signed by the consumer, the merchant may dispute a chargeback with the assistance of the merchant's acquiring bank.
chargeback	The merchant's acquiring bank accepts the risk that the merchant will remain solvent over time as during a chargeback it has to return the funds to the cardholder, and that sum then has to be received back from the merchant, and thus has an incentive to take a keen interest in the merchant's products and business practices.
chargeback	To encourage compliance, acquirers may charge merchants a penalty for each chargeback received.

inside lag	The inside lag comprises the recognition lag (the time taken to recognize the shock) and the decision lag (the time taken to decide on and pursue a response).
inside lag	The inside lag is generally a more severe problem for fiscal policy (government spending and taxation policy) than for monetary policy.
inside lag	Some economists oppose the discretionary use of fiscal stimulus because of the inside lag (the time lag involved in implementing it), which is almost inevitably long because of the substantial legislative effort involved.

microcredit	Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work providing microcredit services to the poor.
microcredit	"By the 1980s, however, the ""financial systems approach"", influenced by neoliberalism and propagated by the Harvard Institute for International Development, became the dominant ideology among microcredit organizations."

microcredit	The commercialization of microcredit officially began in 1984 with the formation of Unit Desa (BRI-UD) within the Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
microcredit	Yunus has sharply criticized the shift in microcredit organizations from the Grameen Bank model as a non-profit bank to for-profit institutions:I never dreamed that one day microcredit would give rise to its own breed of loan sharks ...
microcredit	"But credit programs that seek to profit from the suffering of the poor should not be described as ""microcredit,"" and investors who own such programs should not be allowed to benefit from the trust and respect that microcredit banks have rightly earned.Many microcredit organizations now function as independent banks."
microcredit	The application of neoliberal economics to microcredit has generated much debate among scholars and development practitioners, with some claiming that microcredit bank directors, such as Muhammad Yunus, apply the practices of loan sharks for their personal enrichment.

microcredit	One of the principal challenges of microcredit is providing small loans at an affordable cost.
microcredit	Rather, the principal reason for the high cost of microcredit loans is the high transaction cost of traditional microfinance operations relative to loan size.
microcredit	The result is that the traditional approach to microcredit has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.

moneyness	"The (absolute value of) Delta is close to, but not identical with, the percent moneyness of an option, i.e., the ""implied"" probability that the option will expire in-the-money (if the market moves under Brownian motion in the risk-neutral measure)."
moneyness	"In options trading, terms such as ""in-the-money"", ""at-the-money"" and ""out-of-the-money"" describe the moneyness of options."
moneyness	In finance, moneyness is the relative position of the current price (or future price) of an underlying asset (e.g., a stock) with respect to the strike price of a derivative, most commonly a call option or a put option.
moneyness	This rough classification can be quantified by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number, measuring how far the asset is in the money or out of the money with respect to the strike – or, conversely, how far a strike is in or out of the money with respect to the spot (or forward) price of the asset.
moneyness	"This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the ""relative"" volatility surface: the implied volatility in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price."
moneyness	A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure.
moneyness	Another measure closely related to moneyness is the Delta of a call or put option.
moneyness	"One can also talk about moneyness with respect to the forward price: thus one talks about ATMF, ""ATM Forward"", and so forth."
moneyness	Intuitively speaking, moneyness and time to expiry form a two-dimensional coordinate system for valuing options (either in currency (dollar) value or in implied volatility), and changing from spot (or forward, or strike) to moneyness is a change of variables.
moneyness	"Thus a moneyness function is a function ""M"" with input the spot price (or forward, or strike) and output a real number, which is called the moneyness."
moneyness	"In order for this function to reflect moneyness – i.e., for moneyness to increase as spot and strike move relative to each other – it must be monotone in both spot ""S"" and in strike ""K"" (equivalently forward ""F,"" which is monotone in ""S""), with at least one of these strictly monotone, and have opposite direction: either increasing in ""S"" and decreasing in ""K"" (call moneyness) or decreasing in ""S"" and increasing in ""K"" (put moneyness)."
moneyness	This definition is abstract and notationally heavy; in practice relatively simple and concrete moneyness functions are used, and arguments to the function are suppressed for clarity.
moneyness	There are thus two conventions, depending on direction: call moneyness, where moneyness increases if spot increases relative to strike, and put moneyness, where moneyness increases if spot decreases relative to strike.
moneyness	"The sequel uses ""call"" moneyness – as spot increases, moneyness increases – and is the same direction as using call Delta as moneyness."
moneyness	While moneyness is a function of both spot and strike, usually one of these is fixed, and the other varies.
moneyness	Given a specific option, the strike is fixed, and different spots yield the moneyness of that option at different market prices; this is useful in option pricing and understanding the Black–Scholes formula.
moneyness	This section outlines moneyness measures from simple but less useful to more complex but more useful.
moneyness	Simpler measures of moneyness can be computed immediately from observable market data without any theoretical assumptions, while more complex measures use the implied volatility, and thus the Black–Scholes model.
moneyness	"The simplest (put) moneyness is fixed-strike moneyness, where ""M""=""K,"" and the simplest call moneyness is fixed-spot moneyness, where ""M""=""S."" These are also known as absolute moneyness, and correspond to not changing coordinates, instead using the raw prices as measures of moneyness; the corresponding volatility surface, with coordinates ""K"" and ""T"" (tenor) is the ""absolute volatility surface""."
moneyness	"The simplest non-trivial moneyness is the ratio of these, either ""S""/""K"" or its reciprocal ""K""/""S,"" which is known as the (spot) simple moneyness, with analogous forward simple moneyness."
moneyness	"A volatility surface using coordinates a non-trivial moneyness ""M"" and time to expiry ""τ"" is called the ""relative volatility surface"" (with respect to the moneyness ""M"")."
moneyness	In (call) simple moneyness, ATM corresponds to moneyness of 1, while ITM corresponds to greater than 1, and OTM corresponds to less than 1, with equivalent levels of ITM/OTM corresponding to reciprocals.
moneyness	This is linearized by taking the log, yielding the log simple moneyness formula_2 In the log simple moneyness, ATM corresponds to 0, while ITM is positive and OTM is negative, and corresponding levels of ITM/OTM corresponding to switching sign.
moneyness	Note that once logs are taken, moneyness in terms of forward or spot differ by an additive factor (log of discount factor), as formula_3
moneyness	Since dispersion of Brownian motion is proportional to the square root of time, one may divide the log simple moneyness by this factor, yielding: formula_4 This effectively normalizes for time to expiry – with this measure of moneyness, volatility smiles are largely independent of time to expiry.
moneyness	This is known as the standardized moneyness (forward), and measures moneyness in standard deviation units.
moneyness	In words, the standardized moneyness is the number of standard deviations the current forward price is above the strike price.
moneyness	"Thus the moneyness is zero when the forward price of the underlying equals the strike price, when the option is ""at-the-money-forward""."
moneyness	Standardized moneyness is measured in standard deviations from this point, with a positive value meaning an in-the-money call option and a negative value meaning an out-of-the-money call option (with signs reversed for a put option).
moneyness	"The standardized moneyness is closely related to the auxiliary variables in the Black–Scholes formula, namely the terms ""d""+ = ""d""1 and ""d""− = ""d""2, which are defined as:"
moneyness	The percent moneyness is the implied probability that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure.
moneyness	Thus a moneyness of 0 yields a 50% probability of expiring ITM, while a moneyness of 1 yields an approximately 84% probability of expiring ITM.
moneyness	The other quantities – (percent) standardized moneyness and Delta – are not identical to the actual percent moneyness, but in many practical cases these are quite close (unless volatility is high or time to expiry is long), and Delta is commonly used by traders as a measure of (percent) moneyness.
moneyness	Delta is more than moneyness, with the (percent) standardized moneyness in between.
moneyness	"In fact, formula_32 can be interpreted as measures of moneyness (in standard deviations) and formula_31 as probabilities of expiring ITM (""percent moneyness""), in the respective numéraire, as discussed below."
moneyness	"The use of ""d""− for moneyness rather than the standardized moneyness formula_53 – in other words, the reason for the formula_51 factor – is due to the difference between the median and mean of the log-normal distribution; it is the same factor as in Itō's lemma applied to geometric Brownian motion."
