mojo	These African ideals about charm bags influenced the creation of mojo bags and the spiritual philosophical practice in African-American communities.
mojo	There is also a Central African influence of the mojo bag in African-American Hoodoo.
mojo	"The Bakongo people's ""Nkisi Nkubulu"" looks similar to the mojo bags in Hoodoo."
mojo	The spiritual philosophy of the mojo bag also has Bakongo influence.
mojo	Bakongo spiritual philosophy influenced the creation of mojo bags as African-Americans include certain natural and animal ingredients such as animal bones, animal teeth, claws, human bones or graveyard dirt to house a simbi spirit or an ancestral spirit inside a bag for either protection or healing.
mojo	Other charms found were mojo hands, lucky roots, raccoon penis bones, ceramics, and blue beads.
mojo	These items found in a slave cabin showed enslaved African-Americans used local roots and created mojo hands for protection and healing.
mojo	The word wanga (another word for mojo bag) comes from the Kikongo language.
mojo	"The most common synonym for the word mojo is ""gris-gris"", which literally means ""fetish"" or ""charm""; thus a gris-gris bag is a charm bag."
mojo	The word mooyo means that natural ingredients have their own indwelling spirit that can be utilized in mojo bags to bring luck and protection.
mojo	The term may derive from the use of finger and hand bones from the dead in mojo bags, or from ingredients such as the lucky hand root (favored by gamblers).
mojo	"The ideology of the ancestors and the descendants of the mojo hand used this ""prayer in a bag"" based on their belief of spiritual inheritance, by which the omniscient forefathers of their families would provide protection and favor, especially when they used the mojo."
mojo	The use of red flannel bags for mojo bags was influenced by the Bakongo people's minkisi in Central Africa, and in Hoodoo red symbolizes protection from evil and spiritual power.
mojo	For example, a mojo carried for love-drawing will contain different ingredients than one for gambling luck or magical protection.
mojo	Some mojo bags were made to cause harm and bad luck for slaveholders, and other mojo bags were for protection depending on the ingredients used by the root worker.
mojo	William Webb made mojo bags for enslaved people in Kentucky to keep the peace between the enslaved and their enslavers.
shank	The bit shank is the side piece or cheekpiece of a curb bit, part of the bridle, used when riding on horses.
shank	The bit shank allows leverage to be added to the pressure of the rider's hands on the bit.
shank	The shank and its leverage action is what defines a curb bit as a curb, regardless of mouthpiece.
shank	Some shanks, especially on the Weymouth, have small rings placed midway down the shank to attach a lip strap, a helpful addition to the bit for preventing a horse from grabbing at the shanks with its lips.
shank	The length of the shank determines the degree of leverage put on the horse's head and mouth.
shank	A long lower shank (lever arm) in relation to the upper shank (purchase) increases the leverage, and thus the pressure, on the curb groove and the bars of the mouth.
shank	A somewhat long upper shank in relation to the lower shank increases the pressure on the poll, but does not apply as much pressure on the bars of the mouth.
shank	In this way, a longer shank (up to a point) can allow quieter communication between a well-trained horse and a rider with soft hands, without increasing severity of the mouthpiece.
shank	Some shanks have a loose, rotating ring for rein attachment, others have a solid, fixed ring molded into the shank itself.
shank	"Any moving parts on a shank that allow slight movement in the shanks before the bit engages provide a ""warning"" to the horse, allowing it to respond to lighter pressure, thus allowing more subtle communication between horse and rider when on a loose rein or when introducing a young horse to curb pressure."
shank	Therefore, the type of shank needs to be considered according to the use of the horse.
shank	Though a horse should never be allowed to graze in a bridle, the term came from the mistaken notion that the turned-back shank was to allow the horse to eat with a bridle.
shank	An S curve in a shank does not have a major effect on the angle at which the rein engages, but may alter the balance of the bit at the point the lever arm joins the mouthpiece.

wetware	"Related alternative approaches of digital immortality include gradually ""replacing"" neurons in the brain with advanced medical technology (such as nanobiotechnology) as a form of mind uploading (see also: wetware computer)."
wetware	"Other types of hacking are reality hackers, wetware hackers (""hack your brain""), and media hackers (""hack your reputation"")."
wetware	This invokes deep, fast, built-in image comparison wetware (the same machinery responsible for depth perception) and differences stand out almost immediately.
wetware	"Bioimplants of genetically engineered or stem-cell grown neural tissue may become possible as well.&lt;ref name=""10.1177/1477878511409623""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach are wetware computers."
wetware	The terms biohacking and wetware hacking emphasize the connection to hacker culture and the hacker ethic.
wetware	"Neurobiology, cybernetics and computer technology have advanced to such a point that most people possess ""neuro-cyberbrains""âa technological ""organic-synthetic"" wetware computer user interface implant located in the suboccipital nerve region of the cranium; this allows their minds to seamlessly interact with mobile devices, machines or networks around them."

wetware	"A wetware computer is an organic computer (which can also be known as an artificial organic brain or a neurocomputer) composed of organic material ""wetware"" such as ""living"" neurons."
wetware	While a wetware computer is still largely conceptual, there has been limited success with construction and prototyping, which has acted as a proof of the concept's realistic application to computing in the future.
wetware	The concept of wetware is an application of specific interest to the field of computer manufacturing.
wetware	Due to the difficulty in reducing the size of computers because of size limitations of transistors and integrated circuits, wetware provides an unconventional alternative.
wetware	A wetware computer composed of neurons is an ideal concept because, unlike conventional materials which operate in binary (on/off), a neuron can shift between thousands of states, constantly altering its chemical conformation, and redirecting electrical pulses through over 200,000 channels in any of its many synaptic connections.
wetware	The concept of wetware is distinct and unconventional, and draws slight resonance with both hardware and software from conventional computers.
wetware	In wetware the ideas of hardware and software are intertwined and interdependent.
wetware	The molecular and chemical composition of the organic or biological structure would represent not only the physical structure of the wetware but also the software, being continually reprogrammed by the discrete shifts in electrical pulses and chemical concentration gradients as the molecules change their structures to communicate signals.
wetware	The structure of wetware represents a model where the external structure and internal programming are interdependent and unified; meaning that changes to the programming or internal communication between molecules of the device would represent a physical change in the structure.
wetware	The dynamic nature of wetware borrows from the function of complex cellular structures in biological organisms.
wetware	Bray's argument in favor of viewing cells and cellular structures as models of natural computational devices is important when considering the more applied theories of wetware in relation to biorobotics.
wetware	Unlike wetware the concept of biorobotics is not always a system composed of organic molecules, but instead could be composed of conventional material which is designed and assembled in a structure similar or derived from a biological model.
wetware	In 1999 William Ditto and his team of researchers at Georgia Institute of technology and Emory University created a basic form of a wetware computer capable of simple addition by harnessing leech neurons.
wetware	While this computer is a very basic example of a wetware structure it represents a small example with fewer neurons than found in a more complex organ.
wetware	Fitch believes that an important aspect of the development of areas such as artificial intelligence is wetware with nano-intentionalility, and autonomous ability to adapt and restructure itself.
wetware	In a review of the above-mentioned research conducted by Fitch, Daniel Dennett, a professor at Tufts University, discusses the importance of the distinction between the concept of hardware and software when evaluating the idea of wetware and organic material such as neurons.
wetware	Dennett disagrees with Fitch on certain areas, such as the relationship of software/hardware versus wetware, and what a machine with wetware might be capable of.
wetware	Three companies are focusing specifically on wetware computing using living neurons:
wetware	When the building is destroyed during an altercation involving A.I.M., the New Warriors, the Avengers and Lord Templar, the Doomsday Man escapes and, after concluding that Korman's usefulness as wetware is waning, sets out to replace him with Ms. Marvel.

wetware	The term wetware finds use in works of fiction, in scholarly publications and in popularizations.
wetware	"The ""hardware"" component of wetware concerns the bioelectric and biochemical properties of the CNS, specifically the brain."
wetware	DNA, the immune system, and the evolved neural architecture of the brain are further examples of wetware in this sense.
wetware	The term wetware is used to describe the protocols and molecular devices used in molecular biology and synthetic biology.

bubbles	A bonus is awarded depending on the number of bubbles popped.
bubbles	When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension from the bubble - liquid interface, the bubbles will grow, and this growth can cause damage to tissues.
bubbles	If the ambient pressure reduction is limited, this desaturation will take place in the dissolved phase, but if the ambient pressure is lowered sufficiently, bubbles may form and grow, both in blood and other supersaturated tissues.
bubbles	The location of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known.
bubbles	Clean bubbles that are sufficiently small will collapse due to surface tension if the supersaturation is low.
bubbles	Whether it will come out of solution in the bulk of the solvent to form bubbles will depend on a number of factors.
bubbles	Decompression bubbles appear to form mostly in the systemic capillaries where the gas concentration is highest, often those feeding the veins draining the active limbs.
bubbles	The bubbles carried back to the heart in the veins may be transferred to the systemic circulation via a patent foramen ovale in divers with this septal defect, after which there is a risk of occlusion of capillaries in whichever part of the body they end up in.
bubbles	Bubbles which are carried back to the heart in the veins will pass into the right side of the heart, and from there they will normally enter the pulmonary circulation and pass through or be trapped in the capillaries of the lungs, which are around the alveoli and very near to the respiratory gas, where the gas will diffuse from the bubbles though the capillary and alveolar walls into the gas in the lung.
bubbles	If the number of lung capillaries blocked by these bubbles is relatively small, the diver will not display symptoms, and no tissue will be damaged (lung tissues are adequately oxygenated by diffusion).
bubbles	The bubbles which are small enough to pass through the lung capillaries may be small enough to be dissolved due to a combination of surface tension and diffusion to a lowered concentration in the surrounding blood, though the Varying Permeability Model nucleation theory implies that most bubbles passing through the pulmonary circulation will lose enough gas to pass through the capillaries and return to the systemic circulation as recycled but stable nuclei.
bubbles	While not strictly speaking a phenomenon of decompression, it is a complication that can occur during decompression, and that can result in the formation or growth of bubbles without changes in the environmental pressure.
bubbles	Vascular bubbles formed in the systemic capillaries may be trapped in the lung capillaries, temporarily blocking them.
bubbles	If the diver has a patent foramen ovale (or a shunt in the pulmonary circulation), bubbles may pass through it and bypass the pulmonary circulation to enter the arterial blood.
bubbles	If these bubbles are not absorbed in the arterial plasma and lodge in systemic capillaries they will block the flow of oxygenated blood to the tissues supplied by those capillaries, and those tissues will be starved of oxygen.
bubbles	In this case, the bubbles can distort and permanently damage the tissue.
bubbles	As they grow, the bubbles may also compress nerves as they grow causing pain.
bubbles	Extravascular or autochthonous[a] bubbles usually form in slow tissues such as joints, tendons and muscle sheaths.
bubbles	Exercise during decompression can reduce decompression time and risk, providing bubbles are not present, but can increase risk if bubbles are present.
bubbles	Another study has also shown that older subjects tended to bubble more than younger subjects for reasons not yet known, but no trends between weight, body fat, or gender and bubbles were identified, and the question of why some people are more likely to form bubbles than others remains unclear.
bubbles	The first assumes that dissolved gas is eliminated while in the dissolved phase, and that bubbles are not formed during asymptomatic decompression.
bubbles	The second, which is supported by experimental observation, assumes that bubbles are formed during most asymptomatic decompressions, and that gas elimination must consider both dissolved and bubble phases.
bubbles	The ideal decompression profile creates the greatest possible gradient for inert gas elimination from a tissue without causing bubbles to form, and the dissolved phase decompression models are based on the assumption that bubble formation can be avoided.
bubbles	A fundamental problem in the design of decompression tables is that the simplified rules that govern a single dive and ascent do not apply when some tissue bubbles already exist, as these will delay inert gas elimination and equivalent decompression may result in decompression sickness.
bubbles	A number of empirical modifications to dissolved phase models have been made since the identification of venous bubbles by Doppler measurement in asymptomatic divers soon after surfacing.
bubbles	This model may not adequately describe the dynamics of outgassing if gas phase bubbles are present.
bubbles	The second assumes that bubbles will form at any level of supersaturation where the total gas tension in the tissue is greater than the ambient pressure and that gas in bubbles is eliminated more slowly than dissolved gas.
bubbles	Efficient decompression will minimize the total ascent time while limiting the total accumulation of bubbles to an acceptable non-symptomatic critical value.
bubbles	The physics and physiology of bubble growth and elimination indicate that it is more efficient to eliminate bubbles while they are very small.
bubbles	The usefulness of the model is judged on its accuracy and reliability in predicting the onset of symptomatic decompression sickness and asymptomatic venous bubbles during ascent.
bubbles	The critical ratio hypothesis predicts that the development of bubbles will occur in a tissue when the ratio of dissolved gas partial pressure to ambient pressure exceeds a particular ratio for a given tissue.
bubbles	In this early hypothesis it was predicted that if the ascent rate does not allow the inert gas partial pressure in each of the hypothetical tissues to exceed the environmental pressure by more than 2:1 bubbles will not form.
bubbles	The hypothesis is that these stops provide an opportunity to eliminate gas while still dissolved, or at least while the bubbles are still small enough to be easily eliminated, and the result is that there will be considerably fewer or smaller venous bubbles to eliminate at the shallower stops as predicted by the thermodynamic model of Hills.
bubbles	A study by DAN in 2004 found that the incidence of high-grade bubbles could be reduced to zero providing the nitrogen concentration of the most saturated tissue was kept below 80 percent of the allowed M value and that an added deep stop was a simple and practical way of doing this, while retaining the original ascent rate.
bubbles	Most of the bubble models assume that bubbles will form during decompression, and that mixed phase gas elimination occurs, which is slower than dissolved phase elimination.
bubbles	It is a long process during which inert gases are eliminated at a very low rate limited by the slowest affected tissues, and a deviation can cause the formation of gas bubbles which can produce decompression sickness.
bubbles	Direct ascent from air saturation at approximately 7 msw produces venous gas bubbles but not symptomatic DCS.
bubbles	Neither the excursions nor the decompression procedures currently in use (2016) have been found to cause decompression problems in isolation, but there appears to be significantly higher risk when excursions are followed by decompression before non-symptomatic bubbles resulting from excursions have totally resolved.
bubbles	Starting decompression while bubbles are present appears to be the significant factor in many cases of otherwise unexpected decompression sickness during routine saturation decompression.
bubbles	With the later use of Doppler ultrasound testing, it was realized that bubbles were forming within the body even on dives where no DCI signs or symptoms were encountered.
bubbles	In flight transthoracic echocardiography has shown that there is a low but non-zero probability of decompression sickness in commercial pressurised aircraft after a 24 hour pre-flight surface interval following a week of multiple repetitive recreational dives, indicated by detection of venous gas bubbles in a significant number of the divers tested.

burnout	Young physicians and nurses are at an increased risk for both burnout and compassion fatigue.
burnout	Studies show, it is indicated that those with higher levels of education in their respective field will experience lower rates of burnout and compassion fatigue, while also having increased levels of compassion satisfaction.
burnout	With little compassion satisfaction, both critical care physicians and nurses have reported the above examples as leading factors for developing burnout and compassion fatigue.
burnout	In ICU personnel, burnout and compassion fatigue has been associated with decreased quality of care and patient satisfaction, as well as increased medical errors, infection rates, and death rates, making this issue one of concern not only for providers but patients.
burnout	Those who stay in the healthcare field after developing compassion fatigue or burnout are likely to experience a lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, unwanted images or thoughts, insomnia, stress, desensitization and irritability.

burnout	As each lower stage drops off and the succeeding stage fires, the rest of the rocket is still traveling near the burnout speed.
burnout	In conjunction with the burnout time, the burnout height and velocity are obtained using the same values, and are found by these two equations:
burnout	When dealing with the problem of calculating the total burnout velocity or time for the entire rocket system, the general procedure for doing so is as follows:
burnout	It is important to note that the burnout time does not define the end of the rocket stage's motion, as the vehicle will still have a velocity that will allow it to coast upward for a brief amount of time until the acceleration of the planet's gravity gradually changes it to a downward direction.
burnout	The velocity and altitude of the rocket after burnout can be easily modeled using the basic physics equations of motion.
burnout	The ultimate goal of optimal staging is to maximize the payload ratio (see ratios under performance), meaning the largest amount of payload is carried up to the required burnout velocity using the least amount of non-payload mass, which comprises everything else.
burnout	Although this assumption may not be the ideal approach to yielding an efficient or optimal system, it greatly simplifies the equations for determining the burnout velocities, burnout times, burnout altitudes, and mass of each stage.
burnout	One important concept to understand when undergoing restricted rocket staging, is how the burnout velocity is affected by the number of stages that split up the rocket system.
burnout	Increasing the number of stages for a rocket while keeping the specific impulse, payload ratios and structural ratios constant will always yield a higher burnout velocity than the same systems that use fewer stages.
burnout	However, the law of diminishing returns is evident in that each increment in number of stages gives less of an improvement in burnout velocity than the previous increment.
burnout	The burnout velocity gradually converges towards an asymptotic value as the number of stages increases towards a very high number.
burnout	In addition to diminishing returns in burnout velocity improvement, the main reason why real world rockets seldom use more than three stages is because of increase of weight and complexity in the system for each added stage, ultimately yielding a higher cost for deployment.

burnout	Sleep disturbance correlates directly with stress and burnout presenting that nurses with a higher level of sleep disturbance have lower levels of stress management.
burnout	The issue of burnout tends to be a common factor that many nurses face due to the stress from an overwhelming workload, which can make it hard for some nurses to fall in love with their career field.

bomb	This squadron's Avro Lancasters were undergoing conversion to dropping the Tallboy bomb as a precision weapon, and required the higher accuracy of the SABS for this mission.
bomb	The basic problem in bombing is the calculation of the trajectory of the bomb after it leaves the aircraft.
bomb	Due to the effects of air drag, wind and gravity, bombs follow a complex path that changes over time â the path of a bomb dropped from 100 meters looks different from the one when the same bomb is dropped from 5,000 meters.
bomb	"The path was too complex for early systems to calculate directly, and was instead measured experimentally at a bombing range by measuring the distance the bomb travelled forward during its fall, a value known as the ""range""."
bomb	During the approach to the target, the bomb aimer sets their sights to that angle and then drops the bombs when the target passes through the crosshairs.
bomb	"To use such a ""vector bombsight"", the bomb aimer first requires an accurate measurement of the speed and direction of the wind."
bomb	The accuracy of such systems was limited by the time taken to measure the wind in advance of the bomb run, and the care taken to calculate the results.
bomb	Even without such problems, a long bomb run was needed to ensure the aircraft was approaching along the correct line as indicated by the sights, often several miles long.
bomb	To measure this, the bomb aimer first dials in estimates of the wind speed and direction, which causes the computer to begin moving the bombsights to stay pointed at the target as the bomber moved toward it.
bomb	On 22 December 1939, at a pre-arranged meeting on bombsight policy, Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt stated flatly that the CSBS did not meet RAF requirements and asked for a bombsight that would allow the bomber to take any sort of evasive action throughout the bomb run.
bomb	This, in effect, demanded the use of stabilization in order to allow the bomb aimer to continue making adjustments while the bomber manoeuvred.
bomb	In general use, the bomb aimer simply dialled in estimates for the wind direction and speed, set a dial to select the type of bomb being used, and everything from that point on was entirely automated.

wind	A brief relaxation in upper-level winds allowed the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Karina six hours later before wind shear once again increased, leading to a steady weakening trend and degeneration to a remnant low by 18:00 UTC on September 3.
wind	An increase in wind shear caused the system to weaken to as it made a second landfall east-southeast of Huatabampo, Sonora, around 04:00 UTC on October 12.
wind	After maintaining its intensity for over 24 hours, increasing southeasterly wind shear prompted a rapid weakening trend.
wind	Accompanied by low wind shear, favorable outflow, and over an area of high sea surface temperatures, the system consolidated into a depression the following day.

wind	Situated in a region of low to moderate wind shear, upper-level divergence, and convergence, the low consolidated into a depression the following day while situated roughly 880 km (545 mi) southwest of Mumbai, India.
wind	However it as the depression was located within an area of moderate to high vertical wind shear, it did not develop further.
wind	During the morning of September 15 the depression intensified into a Deep Depression as it moved closer to the Orissa Coast near Chandbali on 16 September and maximum surface wind of 40 knots (74 km/hr) was reported by Chandbali at 1700 UTC of 16 September.
wind	With good outflow and moderate but decreasing wind shear, conditions favored development.
wind	Environmental conditions generally favored further strengthening, with good outflow though moderate wind shear, and late on 19 November the JTWC initiated advisories on Bertie.
wind	Moderate wind shear persisted over the system, preventing immediate development The low turned southwestward, and on 23 December it entered the area of responsibility of MÃ©tÃ©o-France in RÃ©union (MFR).
wind	After passing near Rodrigues, the system weakened again due to persistent vertical wind shear, and on 29 December the MFR again issued the final warning on the system.

wind	In particular, the balanced-flow speeds can be used as estimates of the wind speed for particular arrangements of the atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface.
wind	Balanced-flow schematisations can be used to estimate the wind speed in air flows covering several degrees of latitude of Earth's surface.
wind	The balanced-flow approach identifies typical trajectories and steady-state wind speeds derived from balance-giving pressure patterns.
wind	In summary, the balanced-flow equations give out consistent steady-state wind speeds that can estimate the situation at a certain moment and a certain place.
wind	Not all solutions of the gradient wind speed yield physically plausible results: the right-hand side as a whole needs be positive because of the definition of speed; and the quantity under square root needs to be non-negative.
wind	Each balanced-flow idealisation gives a different estimate for the wind speed in the same conditions.
wind	The wind speed in cyclonic circulation grows from zero as the radius increases and is always less than the geostrophic estimate.
wind	In the anticyclonic-circulation example, there is no wind within the distance of 260 km (point R*) â this is the area of no/low winds around a pressure high.
wind	At that distance the first anticyclonic wind has the same speed as the cyclostrophic winds (point Q), and half of that of the inertial wind (point P).
wind	Farther away from point R*, the anticyclonic wind slows down and approaches the geostrophic value with decreasingly larger speeds.

code	The compilers examine the code and find blocks of code that share information in a specific way.
code	"Since the compiler is guaranteeing that these blocks have specific interdependencies between them, the processor can isolate the code in a single functional unit with its own ""local"" memory."
code	In an EDGE processor, the interdependencies between the data in the code would be noticed by the compiler, which would compile these instructions into a single block.
code	Of course its possible that an entire program would use the same data, so the compilers also look for instances where data is handed off to other code and then effectively abandoned by the original block, which is a common access pattern.

code	Gillham code is a zero-padded 12-bit binary code using a parallel nine- to eleven-wire interface, the Gillham interface, that is used to transmit uncorrected barometric altitude between an encoding altimeter or analog air data computer and a digital transponder.
code	"It is a modified form of a Gray code and is sometimes referred to simply as a ""Gray code"" in avionics literature."
code	The code is named after Ronald Lionel Gillham, a signals officer at Air Navigational Services, Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, who had been appointed a civil member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Queen's 1955 Birthday Honours.
code	The final code variant was developed in late 1961 for the ICAO Communications Division meeting (VII COM) held in January/February 1962, and described in a 1962 FAA report.
code	"The exact timeframe and circumstances of the term ""Gillham code"" being coined are unclear, but by 1963 the code was already recognized under this name."
code	"By the mid-1960s the code was also known as ""MOAâGillham code"" or ""ICAOâGillham code""."
code	As a twelfth bit, the Gillham code contains a D1 bit but this is unused and consequently set to zero in practical applications.
code	Bits D2 (msbit) through B4 (lsbit) encode the pressure altitude in 500 ft increments (above a base altitude of â1000Â±250 ft) in a standard 8-bit reflected binary code (Gray code).
code	The specification stops at code 1000000 (126500Â±250 ft), above which D1 would be needed as a most significant bit.
code	Bits C1, C2 and C4 use a mirrored 5-state 3-bit Gray BCD code of a Giannini Datex code type (with the first 5 states resembling O'Brien code type II) to encode the offset from the 500 ft altitude in 100 ft increments.
code	Specifically, if the parity of the 500 ft code is even then codes 001, 011, 010, 110 and 100 encode â200, â100, 0, +100 and +200 ft relative to the 500 ft altitude.

code	"Each UCS character is abstractly represented by a code point, an integer between 0 and 1,114,111 (1,114,112 = 220 + 216 ""or"" 17 Ã 216 = 0x110000 code points), used to represent each character within the internal logic of text processing software."
code	As of Unicode 15.0, released in September 2022, 293,168 (26%) of these code points are allocated, 149,251 (13%) have been assigned characters, 137,468 (12.3%) are reserved for private use, 2,048 are used to enable the mechanism of surrogates, and 66 are designated as noncharacters, leaving the remaining 820,944 (74%) unallocated.
code	ISO maintains the basic mapping of characters from character name to code point.

code	An HTML or XML numeric character reference refers to a character by its Universal Character Set/Unicode code point, and uses the format
code	"where ""nnnn"" is the code point in decimal form, and ""hhhh"" is the code point in hexadecimal form."
code	Unicode and ISO divide the set of code points into 17 planes, each capable of containing 65536 distinct characters or 1,114,112 total.
code	Within one plane, the range of code points is hexadecimal 0000âFFFF, yielding a maximum of 65536 code points.
code	When assigning characters to previously unassigned code points, the Consortium typically allocates entire blocks of similar characters: for example all the characters belonging to the same script or all similarly purposed symbols get assigned to a single block.
code	Blocks may also maintain unassigned or reserved code points when the Consortium expects a block to require additional assignments.
code	The first 256 code points in the UCS correspond with those of ISO 8859-1, the most popular 8-bit character encoding in the Western world.
code	A grapheme is almost always represented by one code point, for example the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A is represented by only code point U+0041.
code	The grapheme LATIN CAPITAL A WITH DIAERESIS Ã is an example where a character can be represented by more than one code point.
code	When a combining mark is adjacent to a non-combining mark code point, text rendering applications should superimpose the combining mark onto the glyph represented by the other code point to form a grapheme according to a set of rules.
code	It may be made up of three code points or more depending on how the characters are actually composed.
code	All code points given some kind of purpose or use are considered designated code points.
code	The majority of code points in actual use have been assigned to abstract characters.

publish	Citizen journalism allows anyone to post anything, and because of that, journalists are being forced by their employers to publish more news content than before, which often means rushing news stories and failing to verify the source of information.
publish	Citizen journalists are able to publish information that may not be reported otherwise, and the public has a greater opportunity to be informed.
publish	Books are a primary medium for the transmission of ideas, and thus book publishers can be seen as serving as crucial intermediaries between the authors whose works they publish and the society in which such works, and the ideas they contain, circulate.

publish	"Not only did Johnson publish the majority of Priestley's theological works, but he also published his scientific works, such as ""Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air"" (1774â77) in which Priestley announced his discovery of oxygen."
publish	"When Lavoisier began to publish works in France on the ""new chemistry"" that he had developed (which included today's modern notions of element and compound), Johnson had these translated and printed immediately, despite his association with Priestley who argued strenuously against Lavoisier's new system."
publish	Johnson was the first to publish an English edition of Lavoisier's early writings on chemistry and he kept up with the ongoing debate.
publish	Johnson's determination to publish political and revolutionary works, however, fractured his Circles: Dissenters were alienated from Anglicans during efforts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts and moderates split from radicals during the French revolution.
publish	"Johnson refused to publish Paine's ""Rights of Man"" and William Blake's ""The French Revolution"", for example."
publish	Johnson originally agreed to publish the controversial work, but he backed out later for unknown reasons and J. S. Jordan distributed it (and was subsequently tried and imprisoned for its publication).
