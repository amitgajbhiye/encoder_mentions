ski	Some skiers stay out for extended periods using tent s and equipment similar to bushwalkers/hikers , whereas others take relatively short trips from ski resorts on maintained trails .
ski	Modern cross-country ski competition is experiencing a revolution that is resulting in greater compatibility with audiences which began with the addition of the Sprint event to the World Cup and Olympic competitions in 2002 .
ski	There are also special distance ski races , sometimes called ski marathons , like Vasaloppet in Sweden , Birkebeineren in Norway , the Engadin Skimarathon in Switzerland , Gatineau Loppet in Canada , the American Birkebeiner , the Tour of Anchorage in Anchorage , Alaska and the Tug Hill Tourathon in the US .
ski	The highest honour , the Coureur des Bois Gold , is given to those who ski the entire distance and camp out overnight , bringing all their food and gear with them in a big backpack .
ski	Pre-modern skiing troops were armed with crossbow s and ski pole s which had a spear head on the other end .
ski	Skis have and should leave the centre section of the ski clear of the snow when the skier 's weight is evenly distributed between the pair .
ski	The centre section of a classic ski will either have " fish scales " , or ski wax that will stick to the snow ( called the " kick zone " or " grip zone " of the ski ) .
ski	When full weight is transferred to a single ski the kick zone comes into contact with the snow .
ski	Another turning technique is the kick-turn , conducted by lifting the ski while double poling .
ski	The skate-turn transfers the weight onto the turning forward ski as in ice skating .
ski	Other methods of turning include the telemark-turn , using the trailing ski as a rudder , skid-turn and stem christie alpine-turn done from a downhill snowplow .
ski	Skate skiing Skate skiing involves a decisive weight transfer onto one ski angled and then the other , supported by the inner edge of the ski on the snow , which looks similar to an ice skater .
ski	As in classic skiing , transferring weight completely from one ski to the next is essential to learning to skate .
ski	Those who have learned to ice skate or rollerskiing may find ski skating technique easier to learn than classic skiing .
ski	The free technique in XC skiing is not to be confused with freestyle , which describes ski sport where the competitors compete over a mogul course and by performing aerial gymnastics such as spins after launching from a short ramp in the snow .
ski	Skis The ski s are long and narrow , to distribute the weight of the skier and allow the skier to move quickly .
ski	Typical ski dimensions are 2 metres in length , about 5 centimetres in width and one to four centimetres in thickness at different stations along the length of the ski .
ski	Depending on the ski design and purpose , they are fitted to the skier based on height and weight .
ski	The toe of the skier 's footwear is attached to the ski with a binding , while the heel remains free .
ski	Early ski poles were usually made from bamboo , but this was supassed in the 1960s by aluminium or fiberglass construction .
ski	Bindings The binding holds or clips the toe of the boot to the ski .
ski	Glide waxGlide waxes are used to make a ski glide faster , and are applied by ironing onto the ski .
ski	Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow , increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions .
ski	Either combined with the wax or applied after in a spray , powder , or block form , fluorocarbons significantly improve the glide of the ski and are widely used in cross country ski races .
ski	Kick waxThe purpose of kick wax is to provide grip on snow when weight is transferred on a ski ; they are used on classic skis only .
ski	Kick waxes are applied in the kick zone of classic skis if the ski is not a fish-scale , waxless ski .
ski	The difficulty of choosing correct kick waxes to different conditions is nowadays greatly reduced by grip wax tapes , which have a wide temperature range , and are easily applied to the ski bottom .
ski	Kick waxes generate grip by penetrating into the snowflakes when the skier puts his weight on the ski .
ski	If skis are poorly tuned , sometimes the skier can solve thin snow soles caused by a soft wax by beating the ski on the track after kicking ; the opposite problem may be handled by skating .
ski	One way around the problems of standard grip wax is to use a wax grip tape , which is applied to the kick zone of the ski in tape form .
ski	The tape can last for has a very wide temp range ( -20 C to +5 C ) , and can be left on the ski at the end of the day and stored by covering in waxed paper .
ski	Waxless skis In recent decades waxless skis have become popular in the recreational ski market .
ski	A waxless ski is inferior to a finely tuned waxed ski , but does not require the sometimes time-consuming and sometimes costly selection and application of kick wax or klister and will work between temperatures , an important advantage in areas with many sun/shadow boundaries .
ski	There are specialty liquid wax products on the market manufactured for waxless skis , though standard glide wax can also be used on the tips and tails of the ski .
ski	Waxless skis are better suited to recreational and casual skiers who want to ski with minimal time spent on maintenance , as they generally produce too much drag for competitive skiers and those who value comparatively effortless movement .
ski	Waxless skis are sometimes used by Nordic racers during variable ski conditions such as temperatures over freezing .
ski	At the 1976 Winter Olympics held in Innsbruck , US ski team member Bill Koch won a silver medal on waxless skis .

ski	Later , most surnames were changed to adjective forms , e.g. Jakub Wiślicki ( " James of Wiślica " ) and Zbigniew Oleśnicki ( " Zbigniew of Oleśnica " ) , with masculine suffixes - ski , - cki , - dzki and - icz or respective feminine suffixes - ska , - cka , - dzka and - icz on the east of Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth .
ski	Names with masculine suffixes - ski , - cki , and - dzki , and corresponding feminine suffixes - ska , - cka , and - dzka became associated with noble origin .
ski	Today , although most Polish speakers do not know about noble associations of - ski , - cki , - dzki and - icz endings , such names still somehow sound better to them .
ski	In the Republic of Macedonia , the most popular suffix today is " - ski " .
ski	On the other hand , surname endings in - ski and - ov are rare , and are usually of foreign ( mostly Czech ) origin .
ski	The suffix - vych ( son of ) corresponds to the South Slavic - vic , the Russian - vich , and the Polish - wicz , while - sky , - ski , and - ska are shared with both Polish and Russian , and - ak with Polish .

ski	A ski is narrow strip of wood , plastic , metal or combination thereof worn underfoot to glide over snow .
ski	Skis are also fitted to vehicles dedicated to traveling over snow such as snowmobile s and snowcat s. History The Nordic ski technology was adapted during the early twentieth century to enable skiers to turn at higher speeds .
ski	New ski and binding designs , coupled with the introduction of ski lift s and snowcat s to carry skiers up mountains , enabled the development of alpine skis .
ski	Meanwhile advances in technology in the Nordic camp allowed for the development of special skis for skating and ski jumping .
ski	Examining the ski from front to back along the direction of travel , the front of the ski ( typically pointed or rounded ) is the " tip " , the middle is the " waist " and the rear ( typically flat ) is the " tail " .
ski	Length and width The length and width of the ski define its total surface area , which provides some indication of the ski 's " float " , its ability to remain on top of the snow instead of sinking into it .
ski	Sidecut Sidecut is the shape of the edge of the ski as viewed from the top or bottom .
ski	Alpine skis are wider at the tip and tail than they are at the waist ; when rotated onto their edge , known as " edging " , this causes the ski to bend into a curved shape and allows them to " carve " a turn .
ski	Since then , " shaped " skis have dominated alpine ski design .
ski	Camber Camber is the shape of the edge of the ski as viewed from one side or the other .
ski	The technique was first introduced by ski makers in Telemark , Norway , and remained largely unchanged through the 20th century .
ski	In 2002 , skier Shane McConkey led development of the Volant Spatula , an alpine ski developed for skiing deep powder snow .
ski	The Spatula featured " reverse camber " with the tips and tails rising above the waist , in an effort to improve the ski 's ability to float on the snow .
ski	Beginning in the early 2000s , many ski manufacturers began designing skis and bindings together , creating an integrated binding system .
ski	Firstly , they often use a railroad track design , to allow the toe and heel pieces to slide , which in turn allows the ski to flex deeply , without a non-flexing spot underfoot due to the binding .
ski	Secondly , it gives the skier a better control on his skis , since the binding is not only screwed on the ski , but integrated in the ski core via inserts .
ski	Rudolf Lettner of Salzburg began marketing steel edges in 1928 , enabling the ski to grip on hard snow ice .
ski	Downhill ski construction has evolved into much more sophisticated technologies .
ski	In 1991 , designers at Elan produced a very exaggerated version of this race ski , and in 1993 introduced a recreational version described by the company as offering a " parabolic " turn shape .
ski	The more dramatic the difference between the widths of the tip , waist and tail , coupled with the length , stiffness and camber of the ski , the shorter the " natural " turning radius .
ski	Many ski manufacturers label their skis with the turning radius on the top .
ski	For a racing slalom ski , this can be as low as 12 metres and for Super-G they are normally at 33 metres .
ski	The ski is turned by applying pressure , rotation and edge angle .
ski	When the ski is set at an angle the edge cuts into the snow , the ski will follow the arc and hence turn the skier ; a practice known as carving a turn .
ski	When a modern ski is tilted on to its edge , a gap is created between the ground and the middle of the ski ( under the binding ) as only the sides near the tip and the tail touch the snow .
ski	Then , as the skier gently applies pressure , the ski bends easily into reverse camber .
ski	Reverse camber skis have tips and tails that curve up but the waist of the ski can be flat or have camber .
ski	This allows the ski tip to remain above soft powder snow and helps the skier turn easier , faster and with less effort .
ski	The first production ski to feature reverse camber was the Volant Spatula which premiered in the 2002 – 2003 season .
ski	Since then , many manufacturers have experimented with the concept and today rocker and reverse camber can be found in dozens of ski models .
ski	Rocker is the latest innovation in ski tech and has taken over the market .
ski	This innovation has taken a 210 cm powder ski from an 80 m turn radius to a 15 to 25 m turn .
ski	Twin-tip Twin-tip ski s are skis with turned-up ends at both the front and rear .
ski	They make it easier to ski backwards , allowing reversed take-offs and landings when performing aerial maneuvers .
ski	The turned-up tail allows less application of aft pressure on the ski , causing it to release from a turn earlier than a non-twin-tip ski .
ski	Bindings are typically mounted closer to the centre of the ski to facilitate the balance of fore and aft pressure while skiing backwards or " switch " , and built lower to the ski for easy rail sliding .
ski	The popularity explosion of twin-tip skis created a push for the inclusion of more terrain park elements at ski areas .
ski	The first twin-tip ski was the Olin Mark IV Comp introduced in 1974 .
ski	The first company to successfully market a twin-tip ski was Salomon , with their Teneighty ski .
ski	Alpine touring ski The Alpine touring ski is a modified lightweight downhill ski with an alpine touring binding .
ski	Like the backcountry ski , it is designed for unbroken snow .
ski	For climbing steep slopes , skins ( originally made of seal fur , but now made of synthetic materials ) can be attached at the base of the ski .
ski	The heel of the ski boot can be clamped to the ski when skiing downhill and released when climbing .
ski	The type of ski is mainly used with alpine touring boots , which are rigid but lighter than downhill skiing boots , but may be fixed with a binding suitable for skiing in technical mountaineering boots .
ski	Monoski The monoski is wide enough to attach both boots to a single ski .
ski	Due to its extra width and flotation in deep snow , enthusiasts claim it to be a superior powder ski .
ski	Telemark The Telemark ski is a downhill or touring ski , where the binding attaches only at the toe .
ski	The Telemark ski was the first ski with a significant side cut , and evolved in the Telemark region of southern Norway early in the 19th century .
ski	It was popularized by Sondre Norheim of Morgedal in Telemark , when he demonstrated the ski and the Telemark style of skiing to the public at Christiana , Norway beginning in 1868 .
ski	The fact that the foot is only attached to the ski at the toes means that flexible ski boots are worn .
ski	Cross-country Cross-country ski s are very light and narrow , and usually have slight sidecut , though some newer skis are a sidecut more like an alpine ski .
ski	The ski bases are waxed to reduce friction during forward motion , and kick wax can also be applied for adhesion when walking uphill .
ski	Some waxless models may have patterns on the bottom to increase the friction when the ski slides backward .
ski	It involves poling with every stride of the ski .
ski	Employed by military forces to fight in winter conditions , they are the most closely related modern type to the original ski .
ski	Mogul Skis specifically designed for moguls typically have a different flex pattern , are narrower , and have a smaller sidecut than a common carving ski .
ski	The differences let the ski absorb the impact of the moguls with the tip yet have a tail stiff enough to push off the previous mogul .
ski	Jumping Skis for ski jumping .
ski	The process begins with a questionnaire and interview to determine what flex , materials and ski shape will best suit the skier 's skills , weight and target snow and terrain .
ski	During the Winter war , Finnish ski troops became known for appearing out of woods to a road used by a Soviet column , opening fire with M/31s and disappearing into the woods on the other side of the road , and during the Continuation war the Finnish Sissi patrols would often equip every soldier with M/31s .
ski	The highest point , 360 feet , is found twelve miles north of Pereslavskoe ( Drugehnen ) at the ski resort then called the Galtgarben .
ski	It is one of the centres of the Australian ski industry during the winter months , with all four snow resort s in New South Wales being located in the region .
ski	Australia 's first T-Bar was installed at Kiandra in 1957 , but the ski facilities were finally shifted up the hill to Selwyn Snowfields in 1978 .
ski	At 1760m , Charlotte Pass has the highest village base elevation of any Australia ski resort and can only be accessed via over-snow transport in winter .
ski	The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led to the establishment of a cafe at Smiggin Holes around 1939 , where horse drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to be begin the arduous ski to the Kosciusko Chalet .
ski	It was the construction of the vast Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme from 1949 that really opened up the Snowy Mountains for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of Thredbo and Perisher as leading Australian resorts .
ski	Today , Thredbo has 14 ski-lifts and possesses Australia 's longest ski resort run , the 5.9 km from Karel 's T-Bar to Friday Flat ; Australia 's greatest vertical drop of 672m ; and the highest lifted point in Australia at 2037 m. The last establishment of a major skifield in NSW came with the development of Mount Blue Cow in the 1980s .
ski	The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991 , and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere .
ski	Improved vehicular access to the High Country enabled ski-resort villages to be constructed at Thredbo and Guthega in the 1950s by ex-Snowy Scheme workers who realised the potential for expansion of the Australian ski industry .

ski	This genuine skier 's paradise offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes .
ski	It was , however , only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts .
ski	Major ski resort s are located mostly in the various European countries ( e.g. Andorra , Austria , Bulgaria , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Czech Republic , Cyprus , Finland , France , Germany , Iceland , Italy , Norway , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Serbia , Sweden , Slovakia , Slovenia , Spain , Switzerland , Turkey ) , Canada , the United States ( e.g. Colorado , California , Utah , Montana , Wyoming , New York , New Jersey , Michigan , Vermont , New Hampshire ) New Zealand , Japan , South Korea , Chile , and Argentina .
ski	Notable hors catégorie peaks include the Col du Tourmalet , Mont Ventoux , Col du Galibier , the climb to the ski resort of Hautacam , and Alpe d'Huez .
ski	In snowy winters they are popular with cross-country ski ers and snowmobile users .
ski	One notable Christmas celebration was the Winter Festival of 2006 , which , after a badly executed fundraising operation left the city with underwhelming decorations the year before , featured extensive festivities and decoration including an artificial ski slope constructed on Lemon Quay , resulting in a much more successful festival .
ski	The ski resorts have increased in popularity , and many of the Olympic venues scattered across the Wasatch Front continue to be used for sporting events .
ski	Utah is home to world-renowned ski resort s , made popular by the light , fluffy snow and easy accessibility .
ski	Just north of Dixie and east of Cedar City is the state 's highest ski resort , Brian Head .
ski	The consistently dry , fluffy snow led Utah 's ski industry to adopt the slogan " the Greatest Snow on Earth " in the 1980s .
ski	Utah 's ski resorts are primarily located in northern Utah near Salt Lake City , Park City , Ogden , and Provo .
ski	In 2011 , for a fifth year in a row , Deer Valley , in Park City , has been ranked the top ski resort in North America by more than 20,000 readers of Ski Magazine , which has a circulation of over 1.6 million subscribers .
ski	In addition to having prime snow conditions and world-class amenities , Northern Utah 's ski resorts are well liked among tourists for their convenience and proximity to a large city and international airport , as well as the close proximity to other ski resorts , allowing skiers the ability to ski at multiple locations in one day .
ski	This is in contrast to most other states with large ski industries , where resorts are more often located in remote locations , away from large cities , and more spread apart .
ski	Former Olympic venues including Utah Olympic Park and Utah Olympic Oval are still in operation for training and competition and allows the public to participate in numerous activities including ski jumping , bobsleigh , and speed skating .
ski	In addition , UTA provides winter service to the ski resorts east of Salt Lake City and Provo .
ski	Several bus companies also provide access to the ski resorts in winter , and local bus companies also serve the cities of Cedar City , Logan , Park City , and St. George .
ski	The Democrats of Summit County are the by-product of the migration of wealthy families from California in the 1990s to the ski resort town of Park City ; their views are generally supportive of the economic policies favored by unions and the social policies favored by the liberals .
ski	Branding The state of Utah relies heavily on income from tourists and travelers taking advantage of the state 's ski resorts and natural beauty , and thus the need to " brand " Utah and create an impression of the state throughout the world has led to several state slogans , the most famous of which being " The Greatest Snow on Earth " , which has been in use in Utah officially since 1975 ( although the slogan was in unofficial use as early as 1962 ) and now adorns nearly 50 percent of the state 's license plates .
ski	Popular reception The town of Breckenridge , Colorado hosts a week-long festival called " Ullr Fest " each year in January , featuring numerous events designed to win his favor in an effort to bring snow to the historic ski town .
ski	Ullr has gained reverence among ski mountaineers in North America and honoured in good humour for bountiful snowfall .
ski	Neither are monorail and funicular systems , or people mover s , such as amusement park , ski resort and airport transport systems .
ski	The Keweenaw peninsula is home to several ski areas .
ski	Other ski areas are Pine Mountain located in Iron Mountain , Norway Mountain in the town of the same name , and the Porcupine Mountains located in Ontonagon .
ski	The academy has its own golf course and ski slope , located on the northwest edge of the main campus , just outside of the Washington Gate .
ski	Some of the largest ski areas in New England are located in Vermont .
ski	Within a 20 - to 30-minute drive from downtown Vancouver are the North Shore Mountains , with three ski areas : Cypress Mountain , Grouse Mountain , and Mount Seymour .
ski	The first of the so-called Vergeltungswaffen series designed for terror bombing of London , the V-1 was fired from " ski " launch sites along the French ( Pas-de-Calais ) and Dutch coasts .
ski	Mineral King Ski Resort During the early to mid-1960s , Walt Disney developed plans for a ski resort in Mineral King , a glacial valley in California 's Sierra Nevada mountain range .
ski	He brought in experts such as the renowned Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer Willy Schaeffler , who helped plan a visitor village , ski runs and ski lifts among the several bowls surrounding the valley .
ski	Most are near the downtown core ( downtown and Yukon river escarpments , Mt. Mac ski trails , Riverdale , Valleyview , Hillcrest , Granger , Porter Creek , and Mountainview ) and one , Pineridge , is south of downtown .
ski	Many other types of sports and recreation equipment , such as ski s , ice hockey stick s , lacrosse stick s and archery bows , were commonly made of wood in the past , but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium , fiberglass , carbon fiber , titanium , and composite material s. One noteworthy example of this trend is the golf club commonly known as the wood , the head of which was traditionally made of persimmon wood in the early days of the game of golf , but is now generally made of synthetic materials .
ski	These boats have a regular inboard engine , but are turned 180 ° such that the transmission is in front of the engine , rather than behind , or " inline " , which is a more common layout for inboard tournament ski boats .
ski	During Windows XP 's development , the project was codenamed " Whistler " , after Whistler , British Columbia , as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort .
ski	The Finns dressed in layers , and the ski trooper s wore a lightweight white snow cape .
ski	This snow-camouflage made the ski troopers almost invisible as the Finns executed guerrilla attacks against Soviet columns .
ski	The original sports were alpine and cross-country skiing , figure skating , ice hockey , Nordic combined , ski jumping and speed skating .
ski	Three days before the Games IOC president Avery Brundage threatened to bar a number of alpine skiers from competing because they participated in a ski camp at Mammoth Mountain in the United States .
ski	Her medal total was equalled by Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen , who won all three events in his sport .
ski	At 16 years old , Finnish ski jumper Toni Nieminen made history by becoming the youngest male Winter Olympic champion .
ski	The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian cross-country ski team 's residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment .
ski	The ski ballet event , later known as ski-acro , was demonstrated in 1988 and 1992 .
ski	Sports enthusiasts can paddle lakes and rivers with canoe s and kayak s , ride or walk trails , ski or snowboard in an organised setting or access the backcountry by air or snowmobile , climb the highest peaks in Canada or take a family hike up smaller mountains , or try ice climbing and dog sled ding .
ski	On 4 March 2009 , Cook checked into a rehabilitation centre in Bournemouth to fight a " booze addiction " that he has been battling " for some time " . Because of an extended stay in rehab , his performance at Snowbombing , a week-long winter sports and music festival held in the Austria n ski resort of Mayrhofen , was cancelled – with the slot being filled by 2ManyDJs .
ski	The Bogus Basin ski area opened in 1942 and hosts multiple winter activities , primarily alpine skiing and snowboarding , but also cross-country skiing and snow tubing . "
ski	Sports and recreation Granåsen , a Nordic skiing venue located in Byåsen , regularly hosts World Cup competitions in ski jumping , biathlon and cross-country skiing , as well as the 1997 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships .
ski	More recently , tourism supports mountain communities , with some intensive development around attrations such as national park s or ski resorts .
ski	Common individual sports include cross-country skiing , Alpine skiing , snowboarding , ski jumping , speed skating , figure skating , luge , skeleton , bobsleigh and snowmobiling .
ski	Inclined planes are also used as entertainment for people to slide down in a controlled way , in playground slide s , water slide s , ski slope s and skateboard park s. History Inclined planes have been used by people since prehistoric times to move heavy objects .
ski	In the early 1970s , Poppen organized snurfing competitions at a Michigan ski resort that attracted enthusiasts from all over the country .
ski	The " snowboards " were made of wooden planks that were flexible and had water ski foot traps .
ski	Many alpine resorts have terrain park s. Initially , ski areas adopted the sport at a much slower pace than the winter sports public .
ski	In 1985 , only seven percent of U.S. ski areas allowed snowboarding , with a similar proportion in Europe .
ski	In 1990 , most major ski areas had separate slopes for snowboarders .
ski	Now , approximately 97 % of all ski areas in North America and Europe allow snowboarding , and more than half have jumps , rails and half pipes .
ski	Unlike ski bindings , snowboard bindings are not designed to release automatically in a fall .
ski	Four to eight percent of snowboarding injuries take place while the person is waiting in ski-lift lines or entering and exiting ski lifts .
ski	In a study conducted to examine the types of snowboarding injuries and changes in injury patterns over time , data was collected on injured snowboarders and skiers in a base-lodge clinic of a ski resort in Vermont over 18 seasons ( 1988 – 2006 ) and included extensive information about injury patterns , demographics , and experience .
ski	Water skiing is a sport in which an individual is typically pulled behind a boat or a cable ski installation over a body of water , skimming the surface .
ski	Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was optimal .
ski	Samuelson also achieved the first ski jump on 8 July 1925 using a greased by ramp .
ski	Later he tried snow skis but finally made his own design out of lumber , with bindings made of strips of leather and the ski rope made from a long window sash .
ski	Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski , a shorter , finless water ski , in 1940 .
ski	The sport of water skiing remained a little-known activity for several years after 1922 , until the time that Samuelson performed water ski shows , traveling from Michigan to Florida .
ski	Samuelson was also the first ski racer , the first to slalom ski , and the first to organize a water ski show .
ski	Water skiing has developed so that over its history water ski tournaments and water ski competitions have been organized .
ski	The first patented design of a water ski that included carbon fiber was that of Hani Audah at SPORT labs in 2001 , and its first inclusion in tournament slalom skiing was in 2003 .
ski	Speeds vary from as slow as , up to for slalom water skiing , approximately for barefoot skiing , and approaching in water ski racing .
ski	Types Ski Jump The ski jump is when a water skier leaves the surface of the water , with the use of a fiberglass ramp .
ski	Professional ski jumpers can hit the ramp at speeds of up to 70 mph and travel up to .
ski	Traditional ski show acts include pyramids , ski doubles , freestyle jumping , and swivel skiing .
ski	Show skiing is normally performed in water ski shows , with elaborate costumes , choreography , music , and an announcer .
ski	Slalom skiing Slalom water skiing uses only one ski with two plates , a front boot and either a toe plate , open binding , or another binding ( similar to the front binding ) behind the main one .
ski	Tournament slalom skiingIn tournament slalom skiing , a course is set up with buoys and water skiers navigate through and around six buoys using only one ski .
ski	A standard slalom ski rope , used in competition , is always 18.25 meters long .
ski	According to official 2013 Tournament Rules for 3-event Competition in the United States ( and Pan-Am Games ) Ski racing Water ski racing consists of a number of water skiers who race around a set course .
ski	The most common water ski injuries involve the lower legs , such as the knee , because a fall at high speed can create irregular angles of collision between the skier 's body and the water surface .
ski	The record stood at 100 for 24 years before a huge team lead by the ski club broke the record at 114 in 2010 and then increased the number to 145 in 2012 .
ski	The skiers used of ski rope and were towed by the 36 m 3000 hp World Heritage Cruises ' catamaran Eagle .
ski	On 31 August 1974 , David Scott Munro of Ross-shire Caberfeidh Water Ski Club became the first person to water ski ( mono ski ) the length of Loch Ness , Scotland .
ski	A true tournament ski boat will have a direct drive motor shaft which centers the weight in the boat for an optimal wake shape .
ski	However , some recreational ski boats will have the motor placed in the back of the boat ( v-drive ) , which creates a bigger wake .
ski	The boat has a metal ski pylon placed in the center of the boat in front of the engine to connect the skier .
ski	This pylon is mounted securely , since a skilled slalom skier can put a considerable amount of tension in the ski rope and the pylon .
ski	During most years the depth of accumulated snow exceeds and results in the closure of the ski area before the end of the winter months .
ski	He avoided rifle drill by joining the ski division , and then spent every Saturday during the season on the slopes above Turin .
ski	The highest massif in this range is the Moncayo ( 2,313 m ) and , despite getting less snow than in the Pyrenees , it has several ski resorts .
ski	Alpine skiing is the sport of sliding down snow - covered hills on ski s with fixed-heel bindings .
ski	Alpine skiing can be contrasted with skiing using free-heel bindings ; ski mountaineering and nordic skiing – such as cross-country ; ski jumping ; and Telemark .
ski	Today , most alpine skiing occurs at a ski resort with ski lift s that transport skiers up the mountain .
ski	Alternatively , alpine skiers may pursue the sport in less controlled environments ; this practice is variously referred to as ski touring , backcountry skiing , or extreme skiing .
ski	Slalom ski races have courses that require short tight turns , whereas giant-slalom races have courses which are set with more widely spaced turns .
ski	Technique Basic concept If one drops a ball at any given point on a ski run , the ball will be pulled down the hill by gravity and follow a path of least resistance known as the " fall line " .
ski	However , ski runs are generally of finite width and a skier using this technique too slow will eventually move sideways to the edge of the run .
ski	Additionally , the skier can use the same techniques to quickly turn the ski away from the direction of movement , generating skidding forces between the skis and snow which further controls the speed of the descent .
ski	In doing so , the ski pushes snow forward and to the side , and thus by Newton 's third law , the snow pushes the skier back and to the opposite side .
ski	In this technique , the skier uses their lower legs to angle the skis outward at the tails and in at the tips , forming a shallow angle between the ski and upper body .
ski	In this position , the sideways force from one ski is balanced by the opposite sideways force of the other , leaving no net turning forces .
ski	This lowers the turning force on this side , thereby allowing the other ski to dominate and turn the skier toward the straightened ski .
ski	The turn is stopped by forcing this ski out again .
ski	In this case the skis are normally kept parallel to each other , and to initiate a turn , only one ski is forced away from the body .
ski	However , while in the stem Christie only one ski is forced away from the body , in the parallel both skis are forced in the same direction at the same time .
ski	Carving is based on the shape of the ski itself ; when the ski is rotated onto its edge , the pattern cut into its side causes it to bend into an arc .
ski	The contact between the arc of the ski edges and the snow naturally causes the ski to want to move along that arc .
ski	Starting a carved turn simply requires the ski to be rotated onto its edge , which can be accomplished through small movements of the hips and knees .
ski	In this era before ski lift s , all skiing required some cross-country , some uphill climbing , and some downhill skiing .
ski	Equipment during this era was largely similar to modern cross-country gear - a normal leather boot was fastened to the ski at the toe , allowing the heel to rise off the ski to allow striding motions .
ski	By the early 1950s , several " safety bindings " were on the market that allowed the ski to come off when the ski twisted to the side .
ski	In 1950 , Howard Head introduced the Head Standard ski .
ski	This consisted of a conventional wooden ski sandwiched between two thin layers of aluminum .
ski	When the ski was rotated on-edge , the aluminum sheets prevented the wooden core from twisting longitudinally , and kept much more of the ski 's edge firmly pressed into the snow .
ski	A true carving turn was not easy , because the lateral motion of the leg would not be transmitted to the ski through the ski boots of the era .
ski	In the winter of 1965/66 , two new ski boots made of plastic came to market .
ski	Compared to leather designs , the Rosemount and Lange boots dramatically increased the amount of lateral stiffness , and in turn , the amount of edging control over the ski .
ski	The only dramatic changes during this period were in form ; the rear-entry ski boot was common during the 1980s but became unpopular and disappeared by the early 1990s , and Salomon 's introduction of the monocoque ski design led to widespread use of the " cap ski " , different only in that it was cheaper to produce .
ski	By the mid-1990s , many ski hills were dominated by boarders , and their ability to do stunts in terrain parks .
ski	A major change took place after the introduction of the Elan SCX ski in the early 1990s .
ski	The SCX was the first widely available " parabolic " ski , which dramatically improved carving performance .
ski	By 1995 , practically every ski produced had more or less " shaping " , and for a time , carving became a sport onto its own .
ski	A similar change followed with the " rocker " design , which bends the ski into a banana-like shape , as opposed to the classic bow-like shaping with the tips and tails pressed down and the center raised .
ski	Today , almost all skis include both of these design notes , further improving the ability of the ski to be smoothly carved in a wider variety of conditions and terrain .
ski	These rules include such things as regulation ski sizes , sidecuts , boot heights , binding risers and other regulations such as limitations to chemical substances found in winning racers as well as many other things which all ensure one particular skier has no advantage over another .
ski	Some changes included increasing the minimum ski length and also the sidecut which makes the ski turn less tightly .
ski	In 2008 ski lengths were increased as it was found by physiotherapists that the shorter skis combined with the constant knee jerking movements were considered unnecessarily harmful to racers knees due to the turning radius of the skis ( especially the slalom skis ) therefore the F.I.S made the minimum ski length for women in slalom 155 cm and men 165 cm .
ski	More traditional events include gelandesprung jumping ( ski jumping for distance on Alpine equipment ) , and " powder 8 " contests ; among the more recent introductions are " big mountain " or " extreme skiing " contests , in which athletes start at the top of a mountain and ski a route down that involves wide , fast turns as well as cliff drops .
ski	Organization of Alpine ski competition Ski competition rules and scheduling are managed internationally by the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) based in Switzerland .
ski	Alpine ski races are usually organized by a Race Organizing Committee ( ROC ) , led by a Race Chair .
ski	Most regular venues of major Alpine ski races have a local ROC which remains in place from year to year .
ski	Ski trail ratings In most ski resorts , the runs are graded according to comparative difficulty so that skiers can select appropriate routes .
ski	Australian ski slopes also share the same rating system .
ski	The usual ratings are : Japan has more than 1000 ski areas ( 115 in Nagano Prefecture alone ) , many of them small and family-oriented , so comparisons between slope classifications in Japan and " equivalent " slopes in Europe or North America are minimal .
ski	In moguls , the athletes ski down a slope littered with moguls ( bumps ) , attempting to get down in as fast a time as possible while also attempting to get points for technique and their two aerial jumps during the course .
ski	The ski jumping part took place in Park City , while the cross-country part took place in Soldier Hollow .
ski	The organization focused its efforts on patriotic , militaristic , heroic , and environmental Swedish traditions as they relate to ski sports and outdoor life .
ski	The Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in both cross-country skiing and ski jumping .
ski	Competition Until the 1950s , the cross-country race was held first , followed by the ski jumping .
ski	This was reversed as the difference in the cross-country race tended to be too big to overcome in ski jumping .
ski	Prior to 2008 , this event encompassed two jumps from the ski jumping normal hill , and 15 km cross country skiing .
ski	Points are scored in ski jumping for distance and style .
ski	In the cross-country race , a 15-point lead in the ski jump equals a one-minute head start .
ski	The racers with most ski jumping points will start first , followed by the next best jumper after as much time as there was difference in their jumping scores .
ski	This also applies to the large hill ski jump event , formerly the sprint .
ski	At a 28 May 2009 meeting in Dubrovnik , Croatia , it was stated that the 2008 format of one ski jump hill followed by the 10 km cross country skiing event passed the test , resulting in a doubling of television coverage from the previous season .
ski	TeamThe team event consists of four skiers starting from the ski jump with one jump each , then moving onward to cross-country skiing in a 4 x 5 km relay .
ski	The distance is still 7.5 km , but only the best contestant from the ski jumping will run that distance and all others start a given distance behind , based on their scores from the ski jumping .
ski	In the ski jump , no style points are awarded , although jumpers receive fewer points for falling or failing to make a Telemark landing .
ski	The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long ( ) .
ski	History True ski jumping originated in Morgedal , Norway .
ski	Olaf Rye , a Norwegian lieutenant , was the first known ski jumper .
ski	By 1862 , ski jumpers were tackling much larger jumps and traveling longer .
ski	The first widely known ski jumping competition was the Husebyrennene , held in Oslo in 1879 , with Olaf Haugann of Norway setting the first world record for the longest ski jump at 20 metres .
ski	The annual event was moved to Holmenkollen from 1892 , and Holmenkollen has remained the pinnacle of ski jumping venues .
ski	Women 's ski jumping On 26 May 2006 , the International Ski Federation decided to allow women to ski jump at the 2009 Nordic World Ski Championships in Liberec , Czech Republic and then to have a team event for women at the 2011 world championships .
ski	On 28 November 2006 , the proposal for a women 's ski jumping event was rejected by the Executive Board of the IOC .
ski	The Executive Board stated that women 's ski jumping has yet to be fully established internationally .
ski	Jacques Rogge , president of the International Olympic Committee stated that women 's ski jumping will not be an Olympic event because " we do not want the medals to be diluted and watered down , " referring to the relatively small number of potential competitors in women 's ski jumping .
ski	It has been stated that while the number of women in ski jumping is not insignificant , the field has a much wider spread in terms of talent , in that the top men are all of a similar level of strength competitively , while the women are more varied , even in the top tiers .
ski	A group of 15 competitive female ski jumpers filed a suit against the Vancouver Organizing Committee ( VANOC ) saying that conducting a men 's ski jumping event without a women 's event in the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 would be in direct violation of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
ski	The arguments associated with this suit were presented 20 to 24 April 2009 and a judgment came down on June 10 , 2009 against the ski jumpers .
ski	On April 6 , 2011 the International Olympic Committee officially accepted women ski jumping into the official Olympic program for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , Russia .
ski	Mixed Team On June 16 , 2012 a historic first ever world premiere of Mixed Team ski jumping event performing men and women together was held at Mostec in Ljubljana , Slovenia .
ski	Competition was also called Battles of Genders or Duels of Genders and was part of a traditional 42nd International Revial Ski Jumping competition on hills of Arena Triglav Mostec ski jumping complex located in Šiška District , Ljubljana .
ski	Slovenian ski jumpers Maja Vtič and Tomaž Naglič are the first Mixed Team couple winners in history .
ski	On August 14 , 2012 first ever full four members ( two men and two women ) ski jumping Mixed Team , a first ever Mixed Team FIS Grand Prix Ski Jumping event and first ever on plastic was held in Courchevel , France .
ski	Each national mixed team consisted of four ski jumpers , two men and two women .
ski	Rules Ski jumpers below the minimum safe body mass index are penalized with a shorter maximum ski length , reducing the aerodynamic lift they can achieve .
ski	Technique The ski jump is divided into four separate sections ; 1 ) In-run , 2 ) Take-off ( jump ) , 3 ) Flight and 4 ) Landing .
ski	Aerodynamics has become a factor of increasing importance in modern ski jumping , with recent rules addressing the regulation of ski jumping suits .
ski	Previous techniques first included the Kongsberger technique , developed in Kongsberg , Norway by two ski jumpers , Jacob Tullin Thams and Sigmund Ruud following World War I. This technique had the upper body bent at the hip , a wide forward lean , and arms extended to the front with the skis parallel to each other .
ski	The Daescher technique and Windisch technique were the standard for ski jumping from the 1950s .
ski	Almost all world-class ski jumpers come from those regions or from Japan .
ski	However , there have always been successful ski jumpers from other countries as well ( see list below ) .
ski	Ski flying Ski jumping originates from Norway but the homeland of ski flying is Slovenia .
ski	World 's first ski flying hill was in Planica .
ski	List of ski flying hills Ski Flying is an extreme version of ski jumping .
ski	The difference between ski flying and " big hill " ski jumping is subtle , but ski flying puts more focus on the ability to float or glide through the air , and less on pure jumping ability .
ski	Depending on the gear being used , the glide ratios for the " tracking " and " delta " body positions for both sports can be as much as 2:1 , meaning the ski jumper or skydiver can attain as much as 2 metres of travel over ground for every 1 metre of altitude they drop .
ski	Generally , skydivers " fly " through the air twice as fast as ski jumpers .
ski	Nonetheless , most of the top competitors in " regular " ski jumping tend to be among the best in ski flying competitions as well .
ski	However , some jumpers , such as Martin Koch of Austria , Johan Remen Evensen from Norway and Slovenia 's Robert Kranjec are regarded as ski flying specialists .
ski	The " father " of ski flying is Janez Gorišek , an engineer , sportsman and enthusiastic sport-promoter who designed the Planica ski-jump .
ski	There are five ski flying hills in the world today : Vikersundbakken in Vikersund , Norway ; Oberstdorf , Germany ; Kulm Austria ; Letalnica , Planica , Slovenia ; and Harrachov , Czech Republic .
ski	There are plans for more ski flying hills , even for an indoor ski flying hill in Ylitornio , Finland .
ski	It is possible to fly more than in all the ski flying hills , and the current World Record is , set by Norwegian Johan Remen Evensen at Vikersund in 2011 .
ski	Official jumps over 200m Notable ski jumpers The most notable ski jumpers may be considered those who have managed to show a perfect jump , which means that all five judges attributed the maximum style score of 20 points for their jumps .
ski	In addition Eddie the Eagle Edwards should be noted for his hilarious approach to ski jumping and also for his comical appearance .
ski	Other notable ski jumpers can be found in the following lists : Male Female Unsuccessful Important venues National records Water ski jumping The ski jump is performed on two long skis similar to those a beginner uses , with a specialized tailfin that is somewhat shorter and much wider ( so it will support the weight of the skier when he is on the jump ramp ) .

ski	They became known as the " New Canadian Airforce " and helped not only to develop aerial and rail based tricks , but also approached companies with ski designs featuring a twin tip system .
ski	The twin tip works much like a snowboard in allowing the user to ski normally or ski backwards ( switch ) .
ski	New school skiing has grown so much that new ski companies were created , companies that strictly make twin-tip skis — skis that are designed for taking off and landing " fakie " , or " switch " ( backwards ) on jumps and rails .
ski	Forms Aerial skiing Aerialists ski off 2-4 meter jumps , built completely out of snowing using a wood form during the construction period , that propel them up to 6 metres in the air ( which can be up to 20 metres above the landing height ) .
ski	A water ramp consists of a wooden ramp covered with a special plastic mat that when lubricated with sprinklers allows an athlete to ski down the ramp towards a jump .
ski	At most ski resorts certain pistes ( trails ) are groomed infrequently or left completely ungroomed to allow moguls to develop .
ski	Mogul trails that can be groomed are usually groomed when the moguls get so big and the troughs so deep that the moguls become difficult to ski on or around .
ski	Some mogul fields are also groomed when they become too icy or too hardened to ski safely and enjoyably .

ski	After racing on Dynamic VR17 skis during the part of his career when he was dominant , Killy signed a deal with Head Skis in early 1969 to endorse a metal and fiberglass ski named for him , the Killy 800 .
ski	Killy starred as a ski instructor in the 1972 crime movie Snow Job , released in the UK as The Ski Raiders , and US TV as The Great Ski Caper .

ski	One , The Killy Style , was a thirteen-week series that showcased various ski resorts , and the other , The Killy Challenge , featured him racing against celebrities , who were all given handicaps .
ski	In 1974 Killy , as part of this sponsorship deal was paid to ski down the previously unskied eastern slope of Mt Ngaurohoe ( Mt Doom ) in New Zealand .

door	A scenario with a door , which can be open or closed , and a light , which can be on or off , is statically represented by two proposition s open and on .
door	If these conditions can change , they are better represented by two predicate s open ( t ) and on ( t ) that depend on time ; such predicates are called fluent s. A domain in which the door is closed , the light is off , and the door is opened at time 1 can be directly represented in logic by the following formulae : The first two formulae represent the initial situation ; the third formula represents the effect of executing the action of opening the door at time 1 .
door	If such an action had preconditions , such as the door must not be locked , it would have been represented by \ neg \ text ( 0 ) \ rightarrow \ text ( 1 ) .
door	For example , since the action executed at time 0 is that of opening the door , a frame axiom would state that the status of the light does not change from time 0 to time 1 : The frame problem is that one such frame axiom is necessary for every pair of action and condition such that the action does not affect the condition .
door	In the simplified example of the door and the light , occlusion can be formalized by two predicates occlude \ _ open ( t ) and occlude \ _ on ( t ) .
door	It is worth noticing that occlusion does not necessarily imply a change : for example , executing the action of opening the door when it was already open ( in the formalization above ) makes the predicate occlude \ _ open true and makes open true ; however , open has not changed value , as it was true already .
door	The third formula is a different way of saying that opening the door causes the door to be opened .
door	Precisely , it states that opening the door changes the state of the door if it had been previously closed .
door	For example , if open \ _ door ( t ) and close \ _ door ( t ) are two conditions used to denote that the action executed at time t was to open or close the door , respectively , the running example is encoded as follows .
door	For example , the state in which the door is open and the light is on is represented by the term open \ circ on .
door	For example , the action of opening the door at time 0 is represented by the formula : The action of closing the door , which makes a condition false instead of true , is represented in a slightly different way : This formula works provided that suitable axioms are given about state and \ circ , e.g. , a term containing two times the same condition is not a valid state ( for example , state ( open \ circ s \ circ open , t ) is always false for every s and t ) .
door	For example , that the action open \ _ door makes the door open if not locked is expressed by : The semantics of an action description language depends on what the language can express ( concurrent actions , delayed effects , etc. ) and is usually based on transition system s. Since domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in logic , the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an action description logic is to be translated into logic .

scanner	An MRI scanner is a device in which the patient lies within a large , powerful magnet where the magnetic field is used to align the magnetization of some atomic nuclei in the body , and radio frequency magnetic fields are applied to systematically alter the alignment of this magnetization .
scanner	This causes the nuclei to produce a rotating magnetic field detectable by the scanner — and this information is recorded to construct an image of the scanned area of the body .
scanner	Each water molecule has two hydrogen nuclei or proton s. When a person is inside the powerful magnetic field of the scanner , the average magnetic moment of many protons becomes aligned with the direction of the field .
scanner	By changing the settings on the scanner , this effect is used to create contrast between different types of body tissue or between other properties , as in fMRI and diffusion MRI .
scanner	The magnetic field can not vary more than 1/10 ,000 of 1 % and field strength ranges ( depending on the scanner ) from 0.2 to 3 teslas in strength in currently clinically used scanners , with research scanners investigating higher field strengths such as seven teslas .
scanner	An MRI with a 3.0 tesla strength magnet may be referred to as a " 3-T MRI " or " 3-tesla MRI " Since the gradient coils are within the bore of the scanner , there are large forces between them and the main field coils , producing most of the noise that is heard during operation .
scanner	The first magnet in a PMRI scanner is strong , but not uniform .
scanner	These two magnets can be ordinary copper wound magnets , which greatly lowers the cost of an MRI scanner .
scanner	In 1980 Paul Bottomley joined the GE Research Center in Schenectady NY , and his team ordered the highest field-strength magnet then available — a 1.5 T system — and built the first high-field and overcame problems of coil design , RF penetration and signal-to-noise , to build the first whole-body MRI/MRS scanner .
scanner	The basis of this ability is the complex library of pulse sequences that the modern medical MRI scanner includes , each of which is optimized to provide image contrast based on the chemical sensitivity of MRI .
scanner	Interventional MRI The lack of harmful effects on the patient and the operator make MRI well-suited for " interventional radiology " , where the images produced by a MRI scanner are used to guide minimally invasive procedures .
scanner	However , the development of multi-detector CT scanners with near - isotropic resolution allows the CT scanner to produce data that can be retrospectively reconstructed in any plane with minimal loss of image quality .
scanner	To reduce the risks of projectile accidents , ferromagnetic objects and devices are typically prohibited in proximity to the MRI scanner and patients undergoing MRI examinations are required to remove all metallic objects , often by changing into a gown or scrubs and ferromagnetic detection devices are used by some sites .
scanner	Heating caused by absorption of radio waves Every MRI scanner has a powerful radio transmitter to generate the electromagnetic field which excites the spins .
scanner	This is most marked with high-field machines and rapid-imaging techniques in which sound pressure levels can reach 120 dB ( A ) ( equivalent to a jet engine at take-off ) , and therefore appropriate ear protection is essential for anyone inside the MRI scanner room during the examination .
scanner	If the rapidly expanding helium can not be dissipated through an external vent , sometimes referred to as ' quench pipe ' , it may be released into the scanner room where it may cause displacement of the oxygen and present a risk of asphyxiation .
scanner	Alternative scanner designs , such as open or upright systems , can also be helpful where these are available .
scanner	A cardiac cath lab is being studied for the hospital and a new PET/CT scanner was recently installed .
scanner	The modern version of a mimeograph , called a digital duplicator , or copyprinter , contains a scanner , a thermal head for stencil cutting , and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit .
scanner	Anti-virus and anti-malware software A specific component of the Anti virus and anti-malware software commonly referred as the on-access or real-time scanner , hooks deep into the operating system 's core or kernel functions in a manner similar to how certain malware itself would attempt to operate , though with the user 's informed permission for protecting the system .
scanner	Any time the operating system accesses a file , the on-access scanner checks if the file is a ' legitimate ' file or not .
scanner	If the file is considered a malware by the scanner , the access operation will be stopped , the file will be dealt by the scanner in pre-defined way ( how the Anti-virus program was configured during/post installation ) and the user will be notified .
scanner	This may considerably slow down the operating system depending on how well the scanner was programmed .
scanner	Since the VCR was ready to play the color portion of the NTSC recording using PAL color mode , the PAL scanner and capstan speeds had to be adjusted from PAL 's 50 Hz field rate to NTSC 's 59.94 Hz field rate , and faster linear tape speed .

scanner	The technique depends on simultaneous or coincident detection of the pair of photons moving in approximately opposite direction ( it would be exactly opposite in their center of mass frame , but the scanner has no way to know this , and so has a built-in slight direction-error tolerance ) .
scanner	Image reconstruction The raw data collected by a PET scanner are a list of ' coincidence events ' representing near-simultaneous detection ( typically , within a window of 6 to 12 nanoseconds of each other ) of annihilation photons by a pair of detectors .
scanner	There are two approaches to reconstructing data from such a scanner : 1 ) treat each ring as a separate entity , so that only coincidences within a ring are detected , the image from each ring can then be reconstructed individually ( 2D reconstruction ) , or 2 ) allow coincidences to be detected between rings as well as within rings , then reconstruct the entire volume together ( 3D ) .

scanner	While monochrome printers only use one laser scanner assembly , color printers often have two or more scanner assemblies .
scanner	In terms of mathematics , the raw data acquired by the scanner consists of multiple " projections " of the object being scanned .
scanner	However , this is not the only technique available : the original EMI scanner solved the tomographic reconstruction problem by linear algebra , but this approach was limited by its high computational complexity , especially given the computer technology available at the time .
scanner	These techniques are advantageous because they use an internal model of the scanner 's physical properties and of the physical laws of X-ray interactions .
scanner	Earlier methods , such as filtered back projection , assume a perfect scanner and highly simplified physics , which leads to a number of artifacts , high noise and impaired image resolution .
scanner	This led the foundation to another powerful reconstruction method called " Algebraic Reconstruction Technique ( ART ) " which was later adapted by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield as the image reconstruction mechanism in his famous invention , the first commercial CT scanner .
scanner	Commercial scanners The first commercially viable CT scanner was invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield in Hayes , United Kingdom , at EMI Central Research Laboratories using X-rays .
scanner	The scanner had a single photomultiplier detector , and operated on the Translate/Rotate principle .

scanner	Consequently , a UPC scanner can determine whether it is scanning a symbol from left-to-right or from right-to-left ( the symbol is upside-down ) .
scanner	After seeing a start or end pattern ( they are the same bar-space-bar whichever way they are read ) , the scanner will first see odd parity digits if scanning left-to-right or even parity digits if scanning right-to-left .
scanner	With the parity/direction information , an upside-down symbol will not confuse the scanner .
scanner	When confronted with an upside-down symbol , the scanner may simply ignore it ( many scanners alternate left-to-right and right-to-left scans , so they will read the symbol on a subsequent pass ) or the scanner may recognize the digits and put them in the right order .
scanner	This item went on display at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of American History in Washington , D.C. IBM proposal Around 1970 , IBM at Research Triangle Park in North Carolina assigned George Laurer to develop a supermarket scanner and label .

scanner	The stencil , called a master , is made by use of a scanner and thermal print head .
scanner	The sound is focused either by the shape of the transducer , a lens in front of the transducer , or a complex set of control pulses from the ultrasound scanner machine ( Beamforming ) .
scanner	The return sound wave vibrates the transducer , the transducer turns the vibrations into electrical pulses that travel to the ultrasonic scanner where they are processed and transformed into a digital image .
scanner	Forming the image The sonographic scanner must determine three things from each received echo : Once the ultrasonic scanner determines these three things , it can locate which pixel in the image to light up and to what intensity and at what hue if frequency is processed ( see redshift for a natural mapping to hue ) .

scanner	Modern industrial three-dimensional photography may use 3D scanner s to detect and record three-dimensional information .
scanner	Another way to take images of very small objects , " extreme macro " , is to use an ordinary flatbed scanner .
scanner	This is a variation on the shift technique in which the object is turned upside down and placed on the scanner , scanned , moved over and scanned again .
scanner	The file format is most commonly used to represent the density of each colour channel of a scanned negative film in an uncompressed " logarithmic " image where the gamma of the original camera negative is preserved as taken by a film scanner .
scanner	cin file extension ) used for digital images generated by its original film scanner , has then been improved and its latest version ( 2.0 ) is currently published by SMPTE as ANSI/SMPTE 268M-2003 .

scanner	A retail point of sale system typically includes a computer , monitor , cash drawer , receipt printer , customer display and a barcode scanner , and the majority of retail POS systems also include a debit/credit card reader .
scanner	Checkout hardware generally includes a credit card reader , a receipt printer , a cash drawer , a barcode scanner , and a PIN pad with integrated card swipe .
scanner	A rootkit may detect the presence of a such difference-based scanner or virtual machine ( the latter being commonly used to perform forensic analysis ) , and adjust its behaviour so that no differences can be detected .
scanner	The machine listens for ARP requests that go unanswered ( indicating unused addresses ) , then replies to those requests , receives the initial SYN packet of the scanner and sends a SYN/ACK in response .
scanner	This will keep the connection established and waste even more time of the scanner .
scanner	Hence , it distorts the surrounding magnetic field induced by an MRI scanner , causing the nuclei there to lose magnetization faster via the T2 * decay .
scanner	Typically , the unwanted signal called the noise , from the scanner , random brain activity and similar elements , is as big as the signal itself .
scanner	This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal .
scanner	Using head restraints or bite bars may injure epileptics who have a seizure inside the scanner ; bite bars may also discomfit those with dental prostheses .
scanner	One form is scanner drift , caused by the superconducting magnet 's field drifting over time .
scanner	Physiological noise is from head and brain movement in the scanner from breathing , heart beats , or the subject fidgeting , tensing , or making physical responses such as button presses .
scanner	Even with the best experimental design , it is not possible to control and constrain all other background stimuli impinging on a subject — scanner noise , random thoughts , physical sensations , and the like .
scanner	Preprocessing The scanner platform generates a 3 D volume of the subject 's head every TR .
scanner	Several such volumes from a session are joined together to form a 4 D volume corresponding to a run , for the time period the subject stayed in the scanner without adjusting head position .
scanner	The MR scanner acquires different slices within a single brain volume at different times , and hence the slices represent brain activity at different timepoints .
scanner	Distortion corrections account for field nonuniformities of the scanner .
scanner	Hardware A scanner can be useful for transferring penciled sketches/designs of a sprite into a computer .
scanner	This eliminates some of the distortion effects seen with a tube scanner .
scanner	In newer designs , the tip is mounted on a vertical piezo scanner while the sample is being scanned in X and Y using another piezo block .
scanner	The scanner is constructed by combining independently operated piezo electrodes for X , Y , and Z into a single tube , forming a scanner which can manipulate samples and probes with extreme precision in 3 dimensions .
scanner	Because of differences in material or size , the sensitivity varies from scanner to scanner .
scanner	This can be corrected by applying a non-linear voltage to the piezo electrodes to cause linear scanner movement and calibrating the scanner accordingly .
scanner	This causes most of the change in sensitivity to occur in the initial stages of the scanner ’s life .
scanner	As the scanner ages , the sensitivity will change less with time and the scanner would seldom require recalibration , though various manufacturer manuals recommend monthly to semi-monthly calibration of open loop AFMs .
scanner	For the thermal vision , infrared film could not be used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelength s. The filmmakers used an inframetrics thermal video scanner as it gave good heat images of objects and people .

scanner	The hospital is well supported by a radiology department with services including ultrasounds , CT scans as well as a state-of-the-art MRI scanner Education The University of Western Sydney has a Campbelltown Campus , located on Narellan Road .
scanner	A barcode reader ( or barcode scanner ) is an electronic device for reading printed barcode s. Like a flatbed scanner , it consists of a light source , a lens and a light sensor translating optical impulses into electrical ones .
scanner	Additionally , nearly all barcode readers contain decoder circuitry analyzing the barcode 's image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode 's content to the scanner 's output port .
scanner	This waveform is decoded by the scanner in a manner similar to the way Morse code dots and dashes are decoded .
scanner	The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the bar code whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself .
scanner	There are a range of different omni-directional units available which can be used for differing scanning applications , ranging from retail type applications with the barcodes read only a few centimetres away from the scanner to industrial conveyor scanning where the unit can be a couple of metres away or more from the code .

scanner	In computing , an image scanner — often abbreviated to just scanner — is a device that optically scans images , printed text , handwriting , or an object , and converts it to a digital image .
scanner	Common examples found in offices are variations of the desktop ( or flatbed ) scanner where the document is placed on a glass window for scanning .
scanner	Hand-held scanners , where the device is moved by hand , have evolved from text scanning " wands " to 3D scanner s used for industrial design , reverse engineering , test and measurement , orthotics , gaming and other applications .
scanner	A rotary scanner , used for high-speed document scanning , is another type of drum scanner , using a CCD array instead of a photomultiplier .
scanner	Other types of scanners are planetary scanner s , which take photographs of books and documents , and 3D scanners , for producing three-dimensional models of objects .
scanner	Another category of scanner is digital camera scanners , which are based on the concept of reprographic cameras .
scanner	Types Drum Drum scanners capture image information with photomultiplier tubes ( PMT ) , rather than the charge-coupled device ( CCD ) arrays found in flatbed scanners and inexpensive film scanner s. Reflective and transmissive originals are mounted on an acrylic cylinder , the scanner drum , which rotates at high speed while it passes the object being scanned in front of precision optics that deliver image information to the PMTs .
scanner	Light from the original artwork is split into separate red , blue , and green beams in the optical bench of the scanner .
scanner	The drum scanner gets its name from the clear acrylic cylinder , the drum , on which the original artwork is mounted for scanning .
scanner	The sample size is the area that the scanner encoder reads to create an individual pixel .
scanner	The aperture is the actual opening that allows light into the optical bench of the scanner .
scanner	While drum scanners are capable of scanning both reflective and transmissive artwork , a good-quality flatbed scanner can produce good scans from reflective artwork .
scanner	Because film can be wet-mounted to the scanner drum and because of the exceptional sensitivity of the PMTs , drum scanners are capable of capturing very subtle details in film originals .
scanner	Flatbed CCD scannerA flatbed scanner is usually composed of a glass pane ( or platen ) , under which there is a bright light ( often xenon or cold cathode fluorescent ) which illuminates the pane , and a moving optical array in CCD scanning .
scanner	CIS scanner CIS scanning consists of a moving set of red , green and blue LED s strobed for illumination and a connected monochromatic photodiode array under a rod lens array for light collection .
scanner	Usually , uncut film strips of up to six frames , or four mounted slides , are inserted in a carrier , which is moved by a stepper motor across a lens and CCD sensor inside the scanner .
scanner	Scanning documents in this manner requires a steady hand , as an uneven scanning rate would produce distorted images - a little light on the scanner would indicate if the motion was too fast .
scanner	A typical hand scanner also had a small window through which the document being scanned could be viewed .
scanner	To compensate for the uneven motion of the human hand , most 3D scanning systems rely on the placement of reference markers – typically adhesive reflective tabs that the scanner uses to align elements and mark positions in space .
scanner	Smartphone scanner apps Cameras in smartphones have reached a resolution and quality that reasonable quality scans can be achieved by taking a photo with the phone and using a scanning app for post-processing ( such as whitening the background of a page , correcting perspective distortion so that a document is output as a correct rectangle , conversion to black-and-white , etc. ) Most smartphone platforms now have a range of scanner apps available .
scanner	Another qualifying parameter for a scanner is its resolution , measured in pixels per inch ( ppi ) , sometimes more accurately referred to as Samples per inch ( spi ) .
scanner	Instead of using the scanner 's true optical resolution , the only meaningful parameter , manufacturers like to refer to the interpolated resolution , which is much higher thanks to software interpolation .
scanner	, a high-end flatbed scanner can scan up to 5400 ppi and drum scanners have an optical resolution of between 3,000 and 24,000 ppi .
scanner	Purity can be diminished by scanner noise , optical flare , poor analog to digital conversion , scratches , dust , Newton rings , out of focus sensors , improper scanner operation , and poor software .
scanner	The third important parameter for a scanner is its density range or Drange ( see Densitometry ) .
scanner	A high density range means that the scanner is able to record shadow details and brightness details in one scan .
scanner	For the scanned image to be useful , it must be transferred from the scanner to an application running on the computer .
scanner	There are two basic issues : ( 1 ) how the scanner is physically connected to the computer and ( 2 ) how the application retrieves the information from the scanner .
scanner	Direct physical connection to a computer The amount of data generated by a scanner can be very large : a ( 9 " x11 " ) ( slightly larger than A4 paper ) uncompressed 24-bit image is about 100 megabyte s of data which must be transferred and stored .
scanner	Some vendors ( like Umax ) allowed a single scanner connected to a host computer to function as a scanner accessible by all users within a local computer network .
scanner	However , as of 2000 and later , all-in-one multi-purpose devices targeted to serve both ( small ) offices and consumers usually combine a printer , scanner , copier and fax into a single apparatus available to a whole workgroup , providing each individual fax , scan , copy and print functionality .
scanner	Applications Programming Interface A paint application such as GIMP or Adobe Photoshop must communicate with the scanner .
scanner	The API presents a uniform interface to the scanner .
scanner	This means that the application does not need to know the specific details of the scanner in order to access it directly .
scanner	For example , Adobe Photoshop supports the TWAIN standard ; therefore in theory Photoshop can acquire an image from any scanner that has a TWAIN driver .
scanner	In practice , there are often problems with an application communicating with a scanner .
scanner	Either the application or the scanner manufacturer ( or both ) may have faults in their implementation of the API .
scanner	Each scanner manufacturer provides software that translates the API procedure calls into primitive commands that are issued to a hardware controller ( such as the SCSI , USB , or FireWire controller ) .
scanner	Rather the scanner API library translates application requests into hardware requests .
scanner	Common scanner software API interfaces : SANE ( Scanner Access Now Easy ) is a free / open source API for accessing scanners .
scanner	Bundled applications Although no software beyond a scanning utility is a feature of any scanner , many scanners come bundled with software .
scanner	Preparation involves manually inspecting the papers to be scanned and making sure that they are in order , unfolded , without staples or anything else that might jam the scanner .
scanner	Document camera scanners A new category of document scanner is the document camera .
scanner	Conventionally either the illumination/reflector rod inside the scanner must be moved over the document ( such as for a flatbed scanner ) , or the document must be passed over the rod ( such as for feeder scanners ) in order to produce a scan of a whole image .
scanner	This includes in particular documents which are of varying sizes and shapes , stapled , in folders or bent/crumpled which may get jammed in a feed scanner .
scanner	Whilst scanning with document cameras may have a quick reaction time , large amounts of batch scanning of even , unstapled documents is more efficient with an ADF scanner .
scanner	Scanner art Scanner art is art made by placing objects on a flatbed scanner and scanning them .
scanner	There has been some debate as to whether scanner art is a form of digital photography .
scanner	Images made with a scanner differ from those made with a camera , as the scanner has very little depth of field and a constant light all over the surface .
scanner	Though sometimes the scanner or all-in-one printer used to obtain the document image often has some manufacturer software to do this .
scanner	A Javascript to fix this issue is available on the Adobe website - Import and export Preview can directly access image scanners supported by OS X and import images from the scanner .
scanner	Support for acquiring images from a scanner or a digital camera was also added to Paint .
scanner	Barneyscan , first dedicated 35mm slide scanner , introduced 1989 .

scanner	Unnoticed by ground control or pilot , however , this " overexpenditure of fuel " was caused by an intermittently malfunctioning pitch horizon scanner ( PHS ) that later malfunctioned at reentry .
scanner	At the retrofire event , the pitch horizon scanner malfunctioned once more , forcing Carpenter to manually control his reentry , which caused him to overshoot the planned splashdown point by .
scanner	( " The malfunction of the pitch horizon scanner circuit [ a component of the automatic control system ] dictated that the pilot manually control the spacecraft attitudes during this event . "
scanner	Some systems exist with more than 8 bits per channel , and these are often also referred to as true color ( for example a 48-bit true-color scanner ) .
scanner	Pioneering works by Benedict Cassen in developing the first rectilinear scanner and Hal O. Anger 's scintillation camera ( Anger camera ) broadened the young discipline of nuclear medicine into a full-fledged medical imaging specialty .

scanner	However , one optional feature of Flex can cause Flex to generate a scanner with non-linear performance : The use of the REJECT macro in a scanner with the potential to match extremely long tokens .
scanner	Reentrancy By default the scanner generated by Flex is not reentrant .
scanner	This can cause serious problems for programs that use the generated scanner from different threads .
scanner	Usage under non-Unix environments Normally the generated scanner contains references to unistd .

scanner	The flex + + generated C + + scanner includes the header file FlexLexer .
scanner	The film 's plot concerns the attempt by Darryl Revok , a renegade scanner , to wage a war against ConSec .
scanner	Another scanner , Cameron Vale , is dispatched by ConSec to stop Revok .
scanner	Dr. Paul Ruth ( McGoohan ) , head of ConSec 's Scanner Section , introduces the company 's senior scanner ( Louis Del Grande ) , who offers to " scan " a volunteer to demonstrate the banality of the process .
scanner	The demonstration does not go well ; the ConSec scanner 's head explodes .
scanner	Ruth meets with ConSec 's newly-hired head of security , Braedon Keller ( Lawrence Dane ) , to mull Ruth 's two biggest challenges : hunting down Revok and infiltrating the secretive scanner community .
scanner	Ruth thinks both problems can be solved simultaneously using Vale , who might be the only scanner with sufficient psychic power to challenge Revok .
scanner	Vale is reluctant ; Revok 's whereabouts are unknown , and the only lead is Benjamin Pierce ( Robert A. Silverman ) , an artist and unstable scanner who tried to kill his family as a child .
scanner	Vale flings the four assassins into unconsciousness , then scans the dying man 's mind to learn what he knows about the scanner underground .
scanner	Vale is invited to a meeting , but the gathering is ambushed by more of Revok 's assassins , who kill Obrist 's scanner friends before Vale and Obrist can kill them .
scanner	Production The story is structured as a futuristic thriller , involving industrial espionage and intrigue , car chases , conspiracies , and shoot-outs ( including a gruesome scanner duel between Vale and Revok at the end ) .

scanner	Dot pitch ( sometimes called line pitch , stripe pitch , phosphor pitch , or pixel pitch ) is a specification for a computer display , computer printer , image scanner , or other pixel - based device that describes the distance , for example , between dots ( sub-pixels ) of the same color on the inside of a display screen .
scanner	Security A disadvantage of the original NMT specification is that voice traffic was not encrypted , therefore it was possible to listen to calls using e.g. a scanner .
scanner	OMR background Many traditional OMR devices work with a dedicated scanner device that shines a beam of light onto the form paper .
scanner	The OMR software then works with a common desktop image scanner with a document feeder to process the forms once filled out .
scanner	OMR software OMR Software is a computer software application that makes OMR possible on a desktop computer by using an Image scanner to process surveys , tests , attendance sheets , checklists , and other plain-paper forms printed on a laser printer .
scanner	With modern OMR , where the presence of a pencil filled in bubble is recognized , the recognition is done via an optical scanner .
scanner	The first mark sense scanner was the IBM 805 Test Scoring Machine ; this read marks by sensing the electrical conductivity of graphite pencil lead using pairs of wire brushes that scanned the page .
scanner	The first successful optical mark-sense scanner was developed by Everett Franklin Lindquist as documented in US Patent 3,050,248 ( filed in 1955 , granted in 1962 ) .
scanner	OMR may also be done using an OMR ( discrete read head ) scanner or an imaging scanner .
scanner	Progress in OMR now allows users to create and print their own forms and use a scanner ( preferably with a document feeder ) to read the information ( Bergeron , 1998 ) .
scanner	Once the sheet has been filled in , the individual places the sheet on the scanner to be scanned and the printer will print the photos according to the marks that were indicated .
scanner	Shell extensions can be in the form of shell extension handlers , toolbars or even namespace extensions that allow certain folders ( or even non-filesystem objects such as the images scanned by a scanner ) to be presented as a special folder .
scanner	There is an Oberon-2 Lex scanner and Yacc parser by Stephen J Bevan of Manchester University , UK , based on the one in the Mössenböck and Wirth reference .
